You are able to buy 3 different Dlc for multiplayer mode the Massive furry which is fun cause it is huge and parts of it you can use is campaign. Havoc pack which is fun cause of Zeta Prime, Amd the one I highly suggest the Dinobot destructor pack which is awesome cause you get make custom dinobots Grimlock, Swoop, Slug (also known as Slag), and Snarl Unfoutunaltley no Sludge (you will find out why in the game.)

              " \"このゲームは大嫌い！！<br />I really hate this game. When I first started playing, I thought it was pretty decent, mainly because I didn't know better. It has some good features (in theory), but they all fall pretty flat...<br />The feature that lets you record your voice and play it next to a Japanese speaker is kinda of cool, except for the fact that the voice quality is really poor. It's no where near as good as it could be. In the end it just wasn't really that helpful. Because sometimes I couldn't tell what sound she was making.<br /><br />And omiiigoosshhh. Learning Hiragana and Katakana is a nightmare. Once again, its a good idea in THEORY but it falls flat!<br />So you use the stylus to learn the (incorrect) stroke order. You get to see the character drawn first, then you can trace over it to help you learn. Eventually you get quizzed on this, and I can't tell you how freaking frustrating this is. Because most of the time I got the answer WRONG because I didn't draw it EXACTLY right, Point for freaking point. Regardless of the fact that I drew in the right order. Which made it really annoying. It doesn't even teach you everything there is to know about Kana. Heck, it doesn't even show you that there are two different ways to write &#34;さ” and ”ら”!<br /><br />The games are...Not fun. There repetitive, and poorly made.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on grammar. Ooooh boy. It could just be my learning style, but the way this game tried to explain grammar points was extremely confusing and frustrating.<br /><br />This game is just a mess. If you haven't learned Japanese from any other source, you'll probably like it fine. But there are hundreds of better material out there (Like &#34;Genki&#34; and &#34;textfugu&#34; for example), that do a way better job. This game is lazy and leaves out so much vital information.<br />Please don't spend your hard earned cash on this disaster.\",\n",

Some levels are challenging enough, never-mind doing it without dying. Oh and the worst part... When you accidentally die near the end of the level, soul destroying.<br /><br />3) Collect all items: This may seem like a simple task however there is a catch; most levels it's impossible to get all the items on the first go. Why? Well, there are areas where you'll need certain power-ups or specific stickers to be granted access; most of these I guarantee you won't have unlocked until completing levels you haven't unlocked yet! There are also some contraptions which require more than just one player to gain the goodies; this will require more controllers and playing with people online.<br /><br />Having the above three tasks to do make's this game very enjoyable indeed.<br /><br />- Adventure Mode Criticism:<br /><br />The storyline itself I can't complain about, nor can I complain about how adorable and cute the characters are, as well as the levels available being genuinely fun to play, however the adventure mode altogether is actually pretty short...<br /><br />In all LittleBigPlanet games the storyline is broken up into different worlds; each world has around 4 or more story levels with optional challenge levels. LittleBigPlanet had eight worlds, LBP2 down to six (though was sufficient enough), LBP3 however only has four!<br /><br />In LBP3 you have the first world that gets the story going, then the next three which unlock the other main characters shortly followed by the end boss level. I felt it was very short lived as they could have easily done another world once all characters were unlocked which could have focused on them all on several levels, not just one...<br /><br />- Game bugs:<br /><br />Throughout the game you may come across several bugs. Within its first week of release it was rather shocking at how many bugs there were; these bugs consisted of your character getting stuck, unnecessarily dying or falling through the level. However the development team have been really good at fixing a lot of these with recent patches and the game will get continuous support to iron these out; just be sure to download the latest patch before playing thegame.<br /><br />- Create Mode:<br /><br />Explore your imagination and create it into a level that others can experience for themselves by sharing it with the community.<br /><br />The create mode really is fantastic; there are a whole bunch of tools available (old & new), this in addition to now having 16 layers to build on (up from three) allows you to get super creative!<br /><br />If you're new to the create mode, it may seem daunting, however there are some tutorials in game to help you and there are a tonne of videos made available online from other players. Once you get used to the system, you will realise that the create system is actually extremely simple with a little know-how.<br /><br />Once you've created a level and wish to share it with others, then you'll be able to publish the level from your moon of creativity to your planet so people from all around the world to play.<br /><br />- Community:<br /><br />Basically, this is where you can browse through other peoples own published levels and if you like the level, why not heart and favourite it.<br /><br />There are some levels out there that you would have never imagined would be possible to make; it's these levels (some which are even better than what the developers have made) that make you realise just how powerful the creation tools really are.<br /><br />- Downloadable Content:<br /><br />In the world of LittleBigPlanet there is a vast variety of downloadable content available; these range from extra costumes for your lil Sackboy and other characters as well as new adventures or materials and stickers for your own levels. The extra content already available is pretty impressive and there will be more to come. Just bare in mind that whilst some are free, most will require actual payment to unlock.<br /><br />♦ Final Thoughts ♦<br /><br />If you're planning on fully completing and unlocking everything on adventure mode, and have a main interest in the ability to create and share your own levels as well as play other peoples, then you won't be too disappointed.<br /><br />For those who's main attraction is purely on the story levels, do prepare for some good fun however expect it will be fairly short lived.<br /><br />To put this short, this game was severely let down by the lack of story levels.<br /><br />✔ Pros:<br />✓ Fun to play.<br />✓ Easy controls.<br />✓ Adorable characters.<br />✓ A lot of re-playability.<br />✓ Really nice looking texture graphics.<br />✓ Variety of creative tolls to make your own levels.<br /><br />✖ Cons:<br />✘ Story mode is way too short.game.<br /><br />- Create Mode:<br /><br />Explore your imagination and create it into a level that others can experience for themselves by sharing it with the community.<br /><br />The create mode really is fantastic; there are a whole bunch of tools available (old & new), this in addition to now having 16 layers to build on (up from three) allows you to get super creative!<br /><br />If you're new to the create mode, it may seem daunting, however there are some tutorials in game to help you and there are a tonne of videos made available online from other players.

              " '♦ Introduction ♦<br /><br />Grand Theft Auto V first came out on the PS3 & Xbox 360 late 2013; it did amazingly well in sales and was a game that truly stretched the last-gen consoles to their limits. To many this was not only an absolutely stunning looking game, but a really enjoyable one to play too.<br /><br />During the game you get to play with three different characters:<br /><br />∙ Michael: A \\\\\\\\\"retired\\\\\\\\\" bank robber.<br />∙ Franklin: Works for a luxury car dealership as a repossession guy.<br />∙ Trevor: A former military pilot who is a bank robber, drug/weapons dealer & stereotypical redneck; this guy is absolutely insane!<br /><br />Apart from times where the storyline solely concentrates on one character, you can freely switch between each character who has different skills/abilities. They might be near to the character you\\'ve recently switched from, or could be over the other side of the map! In all honesty, I really liked this aspect of the game.<br /><br />That all said, I wasn\\'t quite sure if I was going to dig deep in my pockets to pay full price for a game I already own, just to have it on a different console. As the game was nearing to its release, the more I saw about the improvements which were being made to the game; it wasn\\'t too long before I pre-ordered my copy.<br /><br />♦ Box Contents & Game Information ♦<br /><br />- Inside the case: GTAV game disc | Instruction manual | Game world map.<br /><br />- Game Information: 1 Player (Main Game) | 2-30 Players (Online) | Requires a minimum of 55GB storage space | Supports remote play.<br /><br />- Trophies: 1 Platinum | 3 Gold | 5 Silver | 42 Bronze.<br /><br />♦ What\\'s New? ♦<br /><br />∙ Plays at 1080p at 30fps (Up from 720p which the last-gen consoles played in).<br />∙ First Person Mode: Play GTAV like you\\'ve never played it before!<br />∙ Major graphics improvement (cleaner look, more realistic, better lighting/reflections and less frame-dropping).<br />∙ All extra DLC that was available for the PS3/Xbox comes included on day release.<br />∙ 161 New songs added to the game (Now that\\'s a big increase!).<br />∙ \\\\\\\\\"Improved\\\\\\\\\" Online performance: I can see this happening once the servers settled down, anyone remember what happened last time?<br /><br />The above is what I know of so far; I will update if I find out any further information.<br /><br />- First Person Mode -<br /><br />This mode is quickly activated upon pressing down the touch panel.<br /><br />There are a tonne of available options to cater for this new mode:<br /><br />∙ First Person Control Type: Standard | Alternate | Southpaw | Alt+South | Std FPS | Alt FPS | South FPS | Alt_South FPS | + More.<br />∙ First Person Look-Around Sensitivity: Sensitive Bar.<br />∙ First Person Aiming Sensitivity: Sensitive Bar.<br />∙ First Person On Foot Field of View: Sensitive Bar.<br />∙ First Person Ragdoll: On | Off.<br />∙ First Person Combat Roll: On | Off.<br />∙ First Person Head Bobbing: On | Off.<br />∙ First Person Third Person Cover: On | Off.<br /><br />This mode may require some practice & tweaking of settings to get used to, however it may just be a love or hate option at the end of the day.<br /><br />- Improved Graphics -<br /><br />There\\'s not really much I can say... This game looks like I would have never imagined it before because I thought it already looked great, so seeing it being improved again really is icing on the cake.<br /><br />Textures, lighting, overall graphics... It all looks amazing.<br /><br />♦ Final Thoughts ♦<br /><br />The improvements made to this game are pretty darn significant. If you thought GTAV looked out of this world on the last-gen consoles then hold on to your seat because you\\'re about to be blown away.<br /><br />Now, if you\\'ve played this game on any of the last-gen consoles and didn\\'t enjoy it, buying this game won\\'t change your mind; sure you can appreciate how much better it looks and even smoother play,but it\\'s highly likely you still won\\'t enjoy the game.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed playing this game on either the PS3 or Xbox 360, trust me, you won\\'t be wasting your money purchasing this game again.<br /><br />Would highly recommend.but it\\'s highly likely you still won\\'t enjoy the game.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed playing this game on either the PS3 or Xbox 360, trust me, you won\\'t be wasting your money purchasing this game again.<br /><br />Would highly recommend.',\n",
              " \"♦ Brief ♦<br /><br />Was really impressed with the packaging, smart look and very well presented, but the positive impression I got from the quality of the packaging wasn't reflected on the first glimpse of the headset; whilst the headset is very lightweight, the ear cushions aren't made out of the most comfortable material and the headset overall felt quite fragile and to be quite frank, cheaply made.  But to be fair on Turtle Beach, these are in the lower budget range, so I shouldn't have really expected such high quality.<br /><br />♦ Set-Up ♦<br /><br />When you first get everything out of the box, it does seem like you have to plug in a lot of cables, however it's not as bad as it looks, just follow either of the steps below:<br /><br />- Phone: All you have to do is plug in the cable that's fixed onto the headset and plug it directly into your phone.<br /><br />- Computer: Insert the amplifier cables into the computer (one in the USB port & other in the headphone jack), then plug the headset into the amplifier.<br /><br />- Phone & Computer: Follow the computer steps above, then connect your phone with the included auxiliary cable and plug it into the amplifiers phone port.<br /><br />♦ Mic & Sound Quality ♦<br /><br />The microphone caught me by surprise, I did some voice recording through my phone and the results were very good, sound seemed clean and very crisp.<br /><br />Sound quality I would say is above average, the sound is clear but there's nothing special about it and it most definitely can't handle much bass.<br /><br />One issue I encountered is that the inline amplifier doesn't seem to make a difference... There are two control wheels, one for bass and the other for treble, but no matter how far I turn either one, I can't actually notice a difference in sound.<br /><br />On a good note though, the amplifier has an option which allows you to subtly hear yourself when talking which helps me talk at an appropriate volume, rather than accidentally shouting because I can't hear myself.<br /><br />♦ Comfort ♦<br /><br />At first these seem pretty comfy as they are really lightweight, but after an hour these seem to ache my ears a lot, so they're not something I would use for long gaming sessions.<br /><br />♦ Overall Opinion ♦<br /><br />Definitely not the best headset available, especially when it comes to sound & comfort, but it is very affordable.<br /><br />So if you don't want to splash out loads of money, but want a headset that does the job, then this one is for you.dentally shouting because I can't hear myself.<br /><br />♦ Comfort ♦<br /><br />At first these seem pretty comfy as they are really lightweight, but after an hour these seem to ache my ears a lot, so they're not something I would use for long gaming sessions.<br /><br />♦ Overall Opinion ♦<br /><br />Definitely not the best headset available, especially when it comes to sound & comfort, but it is very affordable.<br /><br />So if you don't want to splash out loads of money, but want a headset that does the job, then this one is for you.\",\n",

Except the cable is rather short.<br /><br />*** This cable is used to connect the headset to a Vita or a Dualshock 4 controller; using it this way will mean you don\\'t need to turn the headset on, nor does the headset has to have any charge.<br /><br />♦ Set-Up & Using ♦<br /><br />As I\\'m sure you\\'re aware of, this headset works with the PS4, PS3 & PS Vita, whichever console you\\'re planning on connecting this headset to, the set-up is very simple and easy to do, just follow one of the steps below.<br /><br />- PlayStation 4 -<br /><br />Wireless Set-Up:<br /><br />1) Insert USB dongle into the PS4.<br />2) Turn the headset on.<br />3) Select the user profile you want to link the headset to (asks every time you turn them on).<br /><br />If you have two of these headsets, you can actually use them both at the same time using two different user profiles, this means you can even both participate in the same party chat.<br /><br />Wired Set-Up:<br /><br />1) Plug the stereo cable into the headset.<br />2) Insert the other end of the cable into the Dualshock 4 controller.<br /><br />Whichever set-up you go for, if no game sound is going to the headset, follow these steps:<br />Settings > Sound and Screen > Audio Output Settings > Output to Headphones > All audio.<br /><br />Alternatively, hold the PS button down and go to \\\\\\\\\"Adjust Devices\\\\\\\\\", you can also tweak the settings there.<br /><br />- PlayStation 3 -<br /><br />Wireless Set-Up:<br /><br />1) Insert USB dongle into the PS3.<br />2) Turn the headset on.<br /><br />The PS3 should configure everything automatically.<br /><br />- PlayStation Vita -<br /><br />Wired Set-Up:<br /><br />1) Plug the stereo cable into the headset.<br />2) Insert the other end of the cable into the Vita.<br /><br />♦ Headset Functions ♦<br /><br />There are many functions on the headset itself, most of which are only usable when wirelessly connected.<br /><br />- Pre-Set Sound Mode -<br /><br />When turning on the headset, if you skip over to \\'2\\' rather than \\'1\\', you can select to use a special pre-set sound mode which enhances the sound to that specific genre, such as \\\\\\\\\"shooter\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\"music\\\\\\\\\" etc...<br /><br />Though you will need to set it up by firstly downloading the \\'Headset Companion App\\', then connect the headset to your PS3/PS4 and upload a sound profile to it through the app.<br /><br />- Sound/Chat -<br /><br />This allows you to adjust the ratio of chat to in-game audio; you can have it balanced, or more swayed to one or the other.<br /><br />- Volume -<br /><br />Will adjust the overall volume.<br /><br />- VSS (Virtual Surround Sound) -<br /><br />Hold this button down to disable/enable, with VSS enabled, you will get the 7.1 VSS.<br /><br />- Mute -<br /><br />This will mute/unmute the microphone.<br /><br />♦ Comfort & Sound Quality ♦<br /><br />This headset is extremely comfortable overall, both the headband and earpads are super soft which make these very comfortable over longer periods of time.<br /><br />Sound quality is great, especially when using the specific sound profiles available on the headset companion app. I\\'ve used the shooter profile on games such as Battlefield 4 & Resogun and am pleased with the results; great sense of direction with clear and crisp sound.<br /><br />I\\'ve had to ask others for their opinion of my mic quality as I can\\'t hear it myself, and everyone I\\'ve asked has said they can hear me very clearly, which is good as the microphone is completely hidden.<br /><br />There is one downside to this and the other previous models which didn\\'t used to bother me, but has been recently, and that has to do with there being no playback when talking on the microphone. Due to the over-ear design, you can\\'t really hear yourself when talking, so as the volume gets louder, you\\'ll find yourself talking more loudly.<br /><br />I hope they can implement an update sometime in the future that will sort this issue out...<br /><br />♦ Gold Headset -VS- Pulse Headset ♦<br /><br />- Gold Headset -<br /><br />+ Foldable design making it easier to store.<br />+ Slightly more comfortable than the Pulses, probably due to it being more lightweight as well as extra width of headband.<br />+ Sound has been improved a bit from the Pulses.<br />+ Longer battery life (up from 6 hours to 8).<br />+ Cheaper in cost (I paid £75 on first release which is £20-£30 cheaper than the Pulses).<br /><br />- Pulse Headset -<br /><br />+ Slider controls rather than buttons.<br />+ Bass impact (was a love or hate feature).<br />+ Multiple sound profiles available to select through at once.<br />+ Has an aux port on the dongle for additional wireless usage with certain devices.<br /><br />Both are great headsets to which both also have their ups and downs compared to each other, however I seem to be using the Golds more.<br /><br />♦ Overall Opinion ♦<br /><br />This is a pretty solid headset that\\'s available for a premium price, though I honestly believe it\\'s money well spent... They\\'re comfortable which means I can wear them for long gaming sessions, and with its crisp sound & VSS feature, it makes me feel more immersed with the gameplay.<br /><br />I\\'ve owned these for about half a year now and couldn\\'t recommend them enough.nd quality is great, especially when using the specific sound profiles available on the headset companion app. I\\'ve used the shooter profile on games such as Battlefield 4 & Resogun and am pleased with the results; great sense of direction with clear and crisp sound.<br /><br />I\\'ve had to ask others for their opinion of my mic quality as I can\\'t hear it myself, and everyone I\\'ve asked has said they can hear me very clearly, which is good as the microphone is completely hidden.<br /><br />There is one downside to this and the other previous models which didn\\'t used to bother me, but has been recently, and that has to do with there being no playback when talking on the microphone.

To use this feature you must:<br /><br />1) Insert the USB dongle into a powered USB socket, be it in the PS3 when turned on, or by using a USB Power Adapter.<br />2) Insert the audio jack cable that was included into the side of the USB dongle, then the other end of the cable into the desired unit (TV or MP3 player).<br />3) Turn on the headset and away you go.<br /><br />The USB dongle will light up green whilst using this feature and it will override any PS3 audio, so if you have it connected to your PS3 and you want to listento the audio from there, just remove the cable.<br /><br />I\\'ve tried this to connect my TV and Walkman wirelessly and it worked perfectly, though it didn\\'t work with my mobile phone.<br /><br />[VITA & other audio devices - 3.5mm Jack Audio Cable]<br /><br />You can use this headset for the PlayStation Vita(audio & voice chat features) by linking the two via the audio cable provided.<br /><br />It is possible to connect this headset to a mobile phone to listen to audio and talk on the phone, however not all phones are supported, unfortunately mine isn\\'t either.<br /><br />Whilst the supplied audio cable worked fine for my Walkman, it does state in the manual that a standard stereo audio cable may be needed to listen to audio content on certain devices.<br /><br />#NOTE; when using the headset for audio purposes via the audio cable, you don\\'t have to have the headset \\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\" for it to work.<br /><br />♦ Quality ♦<br /><br />[SOUND]<br /><br />The sound is absolutely phenomenal, it\\'s very clear and whatever your using the headset for; gaming, music or movies, I\\'m sure you wont be disappointed.

You may get along with this feature from the start or you may not, for me it took some time tweaking the different levels as it varies in different modes, but I\\'ve gotta say once you\\'ve perfected the level, it can be pretty intense. I watched Transformers on Blu-Ray through these headphones via movie mode and set to a decent level of bass impact... completely blew me away.<br /><br />[MICROPHONE]<br /><br />Was very sceptical about this mic at first, it\\'s located on the left headphone as three very small holes.

It's just a very linear first person shooter. Figure out where the bad guys are and kill them. That's it. And finding the bad guys isn't even hard because you're put on a thin pathway that you can't deviate much from.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. There is a place for that in the the video game world. But that wasn't what I was looking for in Homefront. I was hoping this would be a good story where the player is a critical element in restoring freedom, etc etc. While it presents that story up front, it ends up being a relatively short shooter campaign that is very generic and could be part of any shooter game. The whole 'Korea invades America' story is referenced after the initial animation sequence, but it's not really a part of the game play.<br /><br />If you just want to mindlessly walk in a straight line and shoot things, this game might be worth $5 in the used bin at Gamestop.

The game is full of things like that.<br /><br />And it works!

When I got to the end, it didn't even seem to try, content to let us wonder why this 1960s version of XCOM didn't bother to tell 2010s XCOM (of XCOM: Enemy Unknown) that hostile aliens exist and that there's a closet full of working plasma guns somewhere. Not making sense doesn't seem to bother The Bureau, either in story or in its flawed attempt to use permanent death mechanics and strangely shoddy construction. But it sure bothered me.<br />20:53 The Bureau: XCOM Declassified Dev Commentary<br />If the alien-invasion plot could keep its act together for the course of its roughly 15-hour campaign and work as a stand-alone alternate universe, I'd be totally willing to ignore that admittedly nit picky continuity issue. Alas, despite one really good idea that cleverly toys with the way we experience games through characters, it completely falls apart. The way main character Agent William Carter reacts to a major revelation is pretty much the exact opposite of what a sane person would probably do in that situation. It's to the point where I have to wonder if a bug might caused the wrong dialogue option to be selected. This isn’t the only inexplicable moment in this baffling story, but it's the most spectacularly weird.<br />What does work, at a basic level at least, is The Bureau’s tactical combat. Like Mass Effect and Brothers in Arms, each mission against the alien invaders is a linear<br />The Bureau: XCOM Declassified<br />AUGUST 20, 2013<br />The battle of humans against an invading alien force erupts in The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, a new story and unique gameplay experience set inside one of gaming's most storied and beloved franchises.<br />→ MUCH MORE<br />DAN STAPLETON SAYS<br />More tactful tactics<br />Spec Ops: The LineBrothers in Arms: Hell's HighwayMass Effect 3 series of encounters where you and the enemy take cover and open fire, then try to maneuver to flank the other team or drive them from cover using grenades and special abilities. Most of those come from the two lightly customizable XCOM agents that accompany Carter on every mission, and each of the four agent classes has a set that unlocks as they level up in combat. They’re mostly useful: abilities like the Sniper’s critical shot and holographic distraction and the Engineer’s deployable turret and land mines can combine into some satisfyingly lethal crossfires and traps.<br />Squaddies are ordered around using a well-done UI, which allows you to easily set waypoints for your squaddies in the super-slowmo Combat Focus mode (somewhat reminiscent of Fallout 3’s VATS), which you can enable at any time. Its biggest aggravation is in how it sometimes refuses to let you throw a weapon without a walkable path to the landing point, but otherwise it’s a very capable tool.<br />In the other corner is a new alien race called the Zujari, a bland race that fights exactly like humans with advanced technology. Their minions – classic XCOM aliens like impish, mouthless sectoids, lumbering mutons, swift silacoid blobs, and flying drones – all have much more character. With several varieties of Zujari, though, the enemy diversity is respectable, and manages to keep fights from going stale too quickly.<br />01:32The Bureau: XCOM Declassified - Battle Focus Trailer<br />Here's where it all falls apart: The concept of squaddie permadeath (borrowed from X-COM: UFO Defense and Enemy Unknown), simply doesn’t work properly in a game with one character that must live. Any situation where a fight went so badly that I wasn’t able to reach a downed squaddie before his bleedout timer expired was so bad I was probably doomed anyway. And when Carter dies, he and any dead squaddies are revived at the checkpoint to try again. It's a bizarre system that punishes partial failure moreseverely than total failure.<br />Of course, that’s all rendered nearly moot by a revival system that you have to consciously avoid exploiting. Even while they're being pounded on by a huge muton, your two agents can constantly revive each other in an absurd seesaw dance of perpetual near-death. Between those two goofy systems, I lost only two men on my Veteran difficulty playthrough.<br />12:05The Evolution of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified<br />Between missions you return to base to wander around and converse with other XCOM agents and scientists. The base is large, yet there’s not much to do there other than a couple of simple puzzles. The only thing you need to do there is equip your squad, another key idea borrowed from classic X-COM that’s reduced to pointless busywork by an infinite supply of clearly superior weaponry and a lack of a research mechanic (despite franchise tradition and an entire section of the XCOM base labeled as research labs).<br />Captured alien weapons aren't anything special, either. They have some flashy effects, but they're simply more powerful red- or green-glowing variations of ballistic firearms, and none stands out as the slightest bit distinctive. Even the Blaster Launcher is nothing but a green rocket launcher.<br />I can give the Bureau credit for its 1960s setting, which looks pretty good thanks to fine detail in both the base and the towns and rural farms you’re sent out to liberate. A farm mission stands out as particularly atmospheric, with battles playing out from behind tractors and bales of hay, leading to an unexpected hidden area. Scattered notes and voice recordings from civilians succumbing to an alien virus give it a touch of real creepiness. Characters' faces aren't bad, though not particularly well lip-synced to their mostly wooden voice acting. It's commendable that conversations can play out in dramatically different ways based on early conversation choices, such as whether you play good cop or bad cop in an interrogation.

              " \"…the game plays you.<br /><br />The latest installment of the GTA franchise will leave most gamers bored, frustrated…and wistful. With the kind of voice acting, technical wizardry, and amazingly immersive world building that it seems only Rockstar can bring, V could've been a hallmark of game playing. Instead, it seems that the game is simply an excuse to put a Rockstar writer's rejected screenplay in front of millions of unsuspecting gamers.<br /><br />Reams of circular and unnecessary dialogue get in the way of actual gameplay experience, while the story skips in and out of believability. Teeth-grindingly irritating &#34;family life&#34; is played for humor, despite the fact it's precisely what most gamers play video games to get away from. Relentless and tasteless use of the f-bomb and the n-word are supposed to bring an element of realism, but really just make most dialogue and game interactions cringe-worthy.<br /><br />In short, this is a game worth passing on. While there are definitely humorous moments and the voice acting (and motion capture) is superb, I'm playing the game to finish it—and that doesn't describe any other GTA title I've ever played.\",\n",

              " '“Order of Ecclesia” must have hit me at just the right time. According to the in-game clock, I put roughly 25 hrs into this game, with another 5 or so unrecorded as I attempted some of the harder bosses over and over. I have played most of the famously-named “Metroidvania” games in the series, but this one grabbed me more than the others. One difference with “Order of Ecclesia” is that there is a map from which you choose various locations to go to (somewhat similar to “Portrait of Ruin” but not quite). Each location is like a miniature environment you’d explore in other games, but here they have a geographic theme (caverns, mountains, forests, etc.), and there is eventually a surprisingly large Dracula castle near the end of the game. I like the progression of difficulty from one new location to the next. I like how distinct they all feel and how easy traveling between them is. There’s a town you go to early on that acts as a hub for collecting lost villagers hidden throughout the game. The villagers all have something they want you to do and offer numerous quests in return for useful rewards. This has you going back to previous locations, not just to level up or to get that unique drop from a particular enemy, but to also complete a villager’s task, like taking a picture of a yeti before it flees off-screen. I also like the emphasis on magic attacks over typical sword and whip. Every attack no matter what it is drains stamina, so magic can be used just as frequently as anything else, and you realize pretty quickly how much more effective it is. This game is also tough, not in a cheap way but in a ‘I need to learn its movements or use the right attack’ kind of way that kept me unusually engaged. The best in the series is undoubtedly “Symphony of the Night,” though “Order of Ecclesia” might be a close second.  --- 5 STARS ---',\n",
              " '“One does not simply walk into Mordor.” This is a famous line from Peter Jackson’s adaptation of the Lord of the Rings novels. But, in Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor you do just that. Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a third person action, adventure, role playing video-game set J.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings universe. What a game need to be considered good is good gameplay, visuals that are easy on the eyes, a good story, and having all the “new” game mechanics work properly.<br /> You play as Talion, a ranger from in the service of Gondor, a kingdom in Middle-Earth. He and his family are stationed at the Black Gate of Mordor when the dark lord Sauron and his “Black Captains” return to Mordor after two millennia. They kill Talion and everyone he loves, but he is brought back to life by the mysterious powers of an undying spirit, a wraith. The primary objective of the game is to break the curse that binds you and the wraith together, and get revenge on the men that killed you.<br /> The game starts on Talion’s quest for revenge by putting him behind the Black Gate in the near barren region called Udun. Here you see the “Uruks”, or Orcs as they are commonly called in pop culture. This location, and the characters within it are rendered beautifully thanks to the next-gen graphics system that was put into it. One small issue with the graphics is that if you are playing this game on a computer, you are going to need some very strong video hardware to run this game at its top performance levels. But even at lower levels of graphics performance, this game still looks good.<br /> The gameplay primarily focuses on the combat, where you fight the orcs with the brute force of Talion’s sword, his bow for ranged combat and stealth combat with his dagger. Each of these fighting styles look and feel great, and each one can flow seamlessly into the other allowing for a great mix of fighting styles for different play styles. Through the combat and completion of missions you level up and unlock new abilities, each of which flows flawlessly into the game. The major combat will feel very familiar to those who have played the Batman: Arkham series.<br /> The main story of the game is one of revenge where you are trying to kill the men who killed your family, and trying to break the curse binding you and the wraith together. This story is broken up into missions set throughout the open world of Mordor. This aspect can make the story feel a little disjointed because the missions are very spaced out which breaks the overall immersion of the story. These missions always involve other supporting characters as well, such as “Gollum” or a slave rebel named Hirgon, but these characters are often there for one or two missions then gone from the story entirely; which leaves their presence in the story not feeling impactful enough on the player.  In its final moment, when you are about to fight the final battle, the game goes from an action adventure to a quick time event, where press a button when prompted to onscreen. This aspect makes the ending of the game feel extremely hollow, and seems like the developers of the game rushed the ending just to get their game out on store shelves.<br /> The major selling point for the game was the innovative “Nemesis System” which creates new, unique enemy bosses each time a new save file of the game is created. This system is meant to represent the political hierarchy of orcs. These captains and chiefs of the orcs are your main targets outside of the story, which is sad that this system isn’t better integrated into the story. As you wander around the open world you will run into these captains while there are doing their jobs. Shortly after they spot you, a cut scene will play where each captain will have their personal monologue. These small snippets of speech are meant to give player and idea of what the captains overarching goal is, and it is nice to see personality in your enemies, something that is very rare in the video game industry. There are moments however, when these speeches break the immersion and flow of combat. One example is while I was assaulting an orc stronghold in the game. A captain showed up, locked swords with me and started giving me a piece of his mind, then another showed up, and then another one as well each giving me an ear full. That ended up braking the pacing of combat too much.<br /> One thing that was very hotly advertised for this game was being able to dominate, and take control of these captains’ minds. After doing such you were able to command him to go and kill other captains or betray his chieftain, allowing him to become the new chieftain. The one problem with this is that the ability doesn’t become available to you until you are about half way through the game. This leaves a good chunk of untapped potential in the first half and makes it feel very hollow, when compared to the second half of the game.<br /> Overall Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor an overall good game. Its core gameplay is fun an adaptable to each individual player’s style. The visual quality of the game is fantastic so long as you have a machine that can handle it. The “Nemesis System”, while underutilized is fun to play with and gives this game a lot of replay value. For those people looking to play a new action adventure game, or just getting into gaming, this a fine gateway to the world of video games. But for those who are looking for a gripping tale set in Tolkien’s fantasy universe, you are going to want to look elsewhere. The game is great in all the “game” oriented aspects, but when the setting for a game is something as big, and story driven as Tolkien’s universe, one would expect the story to be thrilling, but Shadow of Mordor comes up short in this aspect, and that is the major aspect that keeps this game from being great.',\n",

              " \"“Lords of the Fallen” takes great inspiration from the “Souls” games, tweaks it a little, and comes up with its own twist on the genre. Many things will be familiar to veteran players, like equipment having weight where you’re constantly trying to balance using the very best weapons and armor, making you bulky and slow, versus being more agile, letting you move and roll quicker. Or that when you die you leave behind your experience points at the exact spot you died, and if you die again trying to recover them, they’re gone for good. Even combat will feel similar, with regular and charged attacks, backstab, block and parry, and so on. “LotF” stands out though with some interesting changes. You get an xp multiplier that increases as you kill more enemies, but resets when you visit a save location. This incentivizes you to risk going longer and further without saving or refilling potions. When you do die the xp that you leave behind also has a time limit on it, shown as a percentage meter that slowly decreases. Combat eventually develops its own distinct flow, and I like how you can earn special items by defeating a boss in a specific way (not getting hit, using a lightning weapon, avoiding a certain attack, etc.). “LotF” also has an inspired look, reminding me a lot of the first “Darksiders.” I enjoyed my time with it. What I didn’t enjoy as much is how maze-like some of the areas are (the Catacombs, Chamber of Lies), which are always frustrating to navigate, that once you’ve beaten NG++ you basically have to create a whole new character, that the world overall is a bit small, and that there are some annoying technical issues (screen-tearing, crashing). There's an allure present in the &#34;Souls&#34; games that's missing here. This is a good first game by an unfamiliar developer who I hope gets to make a sequel that capitalizes on its mistakes.  --- 4 STARS ---\",\n",
              " '“Lords of Shadow 2,” an action game in the vein of “Devil May Cry,” starts out competently enough during its early moments, giving you hope. But slowly over the course of its dozen + hours did I finally lose all patience with it. There came a point when I simply wanted to run past enemies. Not because I couldn’t defeat them or because I didn’t need any more experience points, but because the combat just becomes a tiring slog. Near the end, enemies take so many hits, use so many unblockable attacks, and countering seems so ineffective and useless so often that whatever fun there was had long since evaporated. And of course there’s hardly a moment that goes by when playing “LoS2” that you aren’t bombarded by help tips flashing across the screen, constantly reminding you to spend your experience points, or to check out the artwork you’ve unlocked, or to use one of the many abilities you have to solve the sometimes frustrating environmental puzzles. Sure, you could turn it off in the options. But when you find yourself stuck, you’ll have to keep turning it back on. Only in NG+ when you’ve figured everything out can you rid yourself of this aggravation, which don’t just stay on the screen for a second, but remain there, pulsing, making a little repeating chime sound as if to say, “do what I tell you!” Then there’s the design of the world itself, which is an incoherent mess to navigate through. Instead of being broken up into levels or missions, it’s structured similar to past Metroidvania style games in the series, or tries to be, where various sections of the world are linked together, except this time without a helpful map to guide you. There’s no sense of space or location. No way to tell which way is which other than by depending entirely on the waypoint of the mini map. The story – I defy anyone who hasn’t spent hours reading up on it to explain it. I could go on. I wanted to like this game. I like the “Castlevania” series. “LoS2” has terrific visuals and a combat system that’s fun enough on a basic level, but everything else that surrounds it is either undercooked or just frustratingly bad.  Note 1: I should add, the &#34;stealth&#34; sections made me want to throw my controller at the wall.  Note 2: I have experienced a bug that crashes the game whenever you return to a specific area. Some have reported saves being corrupted.  --- 2 STARS ---',\n",

              " '“Final Fantasy X” is a wonderful game, and if you’re a fan of the “Final Fantasy” series or RPG’s, I would suggest checking this one out.  The game has an interesting, complex story that tells the adventures of Tidus, a young man whose world is turned upside down by a giant creature called Sin.  Waking up 1,000 years in the future, he embarks on a journey with a summoner named Yuna and her guardians.  What starts off as just as a regular Pilgrimage to temporarily stop Sin from terrorizing Spira turns into something more.  This game also has many great characters, as well.<br /><br />In addition to a great story and great characters, this game is a lot of fun.  This game takes a long time to beat (it took me a little over 50 hours, and I didn’t even do everything), but it doesn’t get boring.  One thing to mention is the game is linear for a while, which didn’t bother me, but might bother some people.  Farther into the game, though, you have the freedom to go where you want, including a couple secret areas.  The game gives you other extra things you can do, too, such as finding items that let you understand the Al Bhed language and translate messages on old ruins, and you can capture enemies for the battle arena.  You will definitely get a lot out of this game.<br /><br />I always enjoyed the battle system in this game.  It is turned-based, as you’d expect from an RPG, but unlike some games, it gives you more time to make decisions.  Some games have your characters and the enemies getting turns every few seconds, but in this game, you have all the time you need to choose what you want to do.  Once you choose an action, then your turn ends.  I really liked this.  It is not as fast paced, but I get overwhelmed when I don’t have much time to make the best decision in a battle.  I can plan out my strategy better this way.<br /><br />I also liked that the fighting is more flexible than in other games.  You fight with three characters at a time, but you have access to all of them.  You can switch characters during battle at any time, plus you can even switch armor and weapons during the battle, as well.  I love that you aren’t stuck in a battle ill-equipped.  If I am stuck with a bunch of flying enemies and characters with short range weapons, I can switch to characters that can hit flying enemies right in the middle of battle.  It is much better than in other games where I am stuck with an enemy I can’t even hit.<br /><br />I also like the method of making your characters stronger in this game.  The more experience you get in battle, the more you can move around on this Sphere Grid and learn moves and upgrade stats.  As you move around the grid, your characters can learn new abilities, get more health, and more defense, among other things.  Each character has their own section at first, but farther into the game, your characters can go to other characters’ sections.  Like Yuna can learn healing spells, and after a while, you can let Tidus learn healing spells.  And Yuna can go and learn Lulu’s black magic, and so on.<br /><br />A few extra notes.  This game also has pretty good graphics, good voice acting, and also very good music.  Like other “FF” games, there are interesting levels and character designs.  The game is very complex and well-made, and it can also be a good challenge.  My main problem is you can’t skip cut scenes, so it can sometimes be annoying when you die and have to watch a cut scene all over again.  I guess just make sure you’re really prepared for boss battles and save often.<br /><br />So anyway, “FFX” is a great game to play.  It has a great story, great characters, and great gameplay.  And with so many hours of things to do, I think this game is really worth your money.',\n",

              " '‘Mugen Souls Z’ reminds us once again of the whole of life. What is celebrated through these comical characters is the whole of our lives from infancy to adult.<br />Human sexual expression involves the recreation of the original intimacy between mother and infant; as Sartre put it, “that abandon which makes it possible to reproduce the indissoluble intimacy between mother and nursling” (paraphrasing as necessary). Anyone can consider their own experience and see that sexual expression involves overcoming certain inhibitions regarding our nudity and the private parts of our bodies. It is precisely when we are an infant that we feel no inhibitions whatsoever about our bodies. So, we can see that adult sexual expression has a lot to do with childhood. It seems to sum up the whole of our life from infancy to adult.<br />  At another level, we can see that it is possible to express mature ideas through the language of childhood. Sartre said of the poet Jean Genet, whom he considered as possibly the twentieth century’s greatest writer, “He is not an old child; he is a man who expresses a man’s ideas through the language of childhood.” If a man’s ideas can be expressed verbally through the language of childhood, we should be able to infer that such ideas can also be expressed pictorially using the imagery of childhood.

              " '\\u200eI played through the game basically at the insistence of my room-mate, who claimed it was one of his favorite games, and that he has beaten it more than five times. He also couldn’t get any of his other friends to play it anymore, it being a rather old game which was released in 2012. Nearly every time he and I both shared some free time, he would be pestering me to play this game. So, desirous of something which we could enjoy in common, I agreed.<br /><br />I have to say I didn’t really enjoy the game all that much. One nickname for the game on the Internet is “Snorederblands 2,” and that’s because of the game’s essential “Diablo with guns” gameplay: that is to say, endless waves of repetitive enemies which drop incrementally more effective loot that you can use to power up your character. Sounds awesome in theory, but in practice you get tired of facing the same five or six groups of enemies for 40 hours rather quickly.<br /><br />A lot of the thrill of such a game comes from its incremental rewards: finding a neat piece of loot when you kill a difficult boss or open an obscure chest. However, Gearbox (the creators of “Borderlands”) introduced a system in “Borderlands 2” that completely circumvented the need to find loot. They added a “Golden Chest” in the middle of the main city that you could open for rare and powerful items — more powerful than anything you would find in an initial playthrough. To open this chest you need “Golden Keys” which are acquired by entering codes from social media into a special dialog box buried in the “Extras” menu. The problem is, Gearbox left a lot of the codes active for the life of the game, and they have long since been collected on various websites for anyone to use. Combine that with my room-mate’s almost weekly notifications that new codes were available, and I opened the Golden Chest 5 - 10 times with every level that I gained, and I think I still have over 150 keys left. It totally removed the incremental reward system from the game, which was sort of a bummer.<br /><br />The dialogue and humor of the game is often frequently mentioned as a strong point, and while I found it amusing, it never really “clicked” with me to the point where I found it hilarious. It seemed to verge almost completely on “Internet humor” with death and mayhem and memes. Human life is a cheap trifling thing in a game like Borderlands. But, I guess that’s true for all video games.<br /><br />I was playing as the melee-centric character “Krieg” the “Psycho,” and once I got his ultimate “Mania” tree power — the ability to grow twice in size and deal out twice as much melee damage — I started to have a lot more fun. I stacked a bunch of other bonuses with my various skills and items so at the end I think I had something like 600% melee damage, when raging. I was doing 100 - 105K in melee strikes by the end of the game, probably nothing compared to a level capped character, but it seemed like a lot to me, at level 36. Combined with the 50% damage reduction I got while raging, I was basically an unstoppable maelstrom of death as long as I found a good place to retreat to once it wore off.<br />My room-mate played as “Maya” the “Siren” character, who specializes in healing and/or crowd control. Unlike myself, who stuck with one build through the whole game, he shifted around his skill points as the situation demanded, or as whim struck him. He is a far more skilled gamer than I am, regularly getting 2.0 K/D in Call of Duty matches, so his effectiveness with a sniper rifle was very useful. He also eventually got the ultimate skill, a “battle res” that could instantly revive me from death, which was useful when I could charge into a situation a little over my head.<br /><br />All-in-all I’d give “Borderlands 2” a hesitant “thumbs up,” and a rating of three stars out of five. I enjoyed my time with it, but due to its repetitive nature I could really only stomach it in segments of an hour to two hours of play.',\n",

These are the perfect size for me to store and carry portable digital recorders like my [[ASIN:B002KGV3C6 Sony PCM-M10/R Portable Linear PCM Recorder, 96 kHz/24-bit, 4GB Memory & USB High-Speed Port, Glossy Red]] and [[ASIN:B004M8ST2W Sony ICD-SX712 Digital Flash Voice Recorder]].  Unfortunately, Sony does not include a nice carrying case for their digital recorders, which I think is lame.  But Amazon currently sells this at a heavily discounted price, and this is a perfect size for carrying my digital recorders, with room to spare for carrying other recording accessories like wind screens, ear buds, USB cord, extra batteries, and extra Memory Stick Micro (M2) and MicroSD memory cards.  The interior space is about 5.5\\\\\\\\\"x3.0\\\\\\\\\"x1.0\\\\\\\\\".<br /><br />This is a really high quality plush carrying case with three layers of protection: an outside layer of waterproof neoprene (even though prolonged exposure to water/rain will eventually soak through the seams and zipper), a middle layer of foam, and a shock-absorbing interior that is lined with soft raised round bumps that feels like a rubbery version of bubble wrap.  There is an extra external pocket that runs the length of the carrying case where you can store accessories like ear buds.  I do wish that this extra pocket was also enclosed by a zipper, but that is just a minor quibble.  The carrying case has a Velcro-attached belt loop on the back so you can carry this case on your belt, or strap it onto the outside of your backpack or laptop bag.',\n",
              " 'இ Fuzzy Wuzzy\\'s Summary:<br />ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />The Mini Elite Transporter Case is a roomy sturdily-made carrying case that can easily hold and protect your Nintendo 3DS, DSi, or DS Lite.  Your Nintendo console is securely held in between two compartments of a double-clamshell design.  The inside console sleeve is also nicely padded and the inner sleeve can accommodate a console device measuring up to 6.0\\\\\\\\\"x3.2\\\\\\\\\"x0.7\\\\\\\\\".<br /><br />Some of the Nintendo Mini Elite Transporter Case\\'s features are described and rated below:<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ Excellent 5-fuzzies feature ratings:<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ This case is roomy and extremely well-padded.  With the game console snugly tucked away inside this case, I have no doubts that it could survive totally unscathed if the case tumbled down a flight of stairs or fell from a second-floor balcony.  The exterior material is waterproof; however, if this case was subjected to heavy rain, moisture would eventually soak through the zipper areas.<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ The interior of this case is nicely thought out in its design.  Along with the padded game console sleeve, the main compartment also has two larger elastic loops and four smaller elastic loops for holding stylus pens.<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ The build quality of this case is very high, with very sturdy zippers, stitching, and seams.  This case will easily withstand any wear and tear abuse that is dished out by kids and teenagers.<br /><br />ѾѾѾѾѾ This carrying case currently has a great price for its size and construction quality.  I also have the [[ASIN:B002N4TQXI PSP Go Soft Carrying Case]] that holds a Sony PlayStation Portable, and for a few dollars more than the PSP Go Soft Carrying Case, you get a case that is more than twice as large, utilizes much more padding and materials used in its construction, and is built better in all areas (the PSP Go Soft Carrying Case is nice, but it is much more simple and has less padding).<br /><br />ѾѾѾ Not-so-good 3-fuzzies feature ratings:<br /><br />ѾѾѾ With all of the attention to detail paid to the interior layout of this case, I was surprised that it did not include some kind of belt loop/clip.  On my PSP Go Soft Carrying Case that holds a Sony PlayStation Portable, there is a Velcro-attached belt loop on the back so I can carry my PSP on my belt, or strap it onto the outside of my backpack, carry-on luggage, etc.  This case could have been more versatile if it had a similar Velcro-attached belt loop in addition to its top carrying handle loop.<br /><br />ѾѾѾ The rear compartment of the case has 12 elastic pockets for holding game cards.  However, these elastic pockets are too stretchy and loose, and unless the case is kept upright all the time, the game cards can slip out of their pockets.  Considering that both the inside pocket that holds the game console and the outside flap are both secured using Velcro, the game cards should have also been secured using Velcro, either as 12 separate pockets or as one or two larger pouches covered with a Velcro flap.  Some bags and backpacks for digital cameras use Velcro-secured pouches to hold memory cards this way.<br /><br />ѾѾѾ This case is a bit too bulky.  It is too big to fit inside cargo pants\\' pockets (and you cannot carry it on your belt because it lacks a belt loop), and depending upon what kind of AC charger or car charger you want to pack inside this case, it may be a bit too small to pack together stylus pens, ear bud headphones, cables, and then also include a charger.  Personally, IMO, I could done without the separate zippered rear compartment for holding the 12 game cards.  The front of the main compartment has a thin narrow (3\\\\\\\\\" wide, 5\\\\\\\\\" deep) outer sleeve that has no zipper and remains open on one end, but its opening is secured by closing the carrying case\\'s main Velcro flap.  I also have no use for this skinny pocket either.  I could put stylus pens, cables, or ear buds insidethis sleeve, but it would be a very tight fit, and I do not want to risk pushing accessories deep down into this tight pocket because it would then be a royal pain to extract small items from deep inside this tight pocket.  So this outer sleeve is also wasted space that adds to the case\\'s bulk.<br /><br />௫ Fuzzy Wuzzy\\'s Conclusion:<br /><br />Overall, this is a great carrying case for the 3DS.  Its build quality is even better than some budget digital camera carrying cases that I have seen.  But this case could have been more useful and practical if:<br /><br />1) The zippered rear compartment for holding the 12 game cards was removed, and a separate game card pocket assembly was woven into the main zippered compartment.  This removes 0.75-inches of the carrying case\\'s thickness.  Also remove the outer sleeve that is on the front of the case.<br /><br />2) With the 0.75-inch thick game card compartment removed, increase the depth of the main compartment by an extra 0.30 to 0.50 inches.  This would both provide extra room for storing the 12 game cards inside a separate pocket in the main compartment and also provide extra room for packing a charger inside as well while still making the overall case thinner.<br /><br />3) Add a wide stiff sturdy Velcro-secured belt loop on the rear of the carrying case where the (now-removed) game card compartment used to be.  While a belt loop that is sewn into a case makes it usable for belts, a Velcro-secured belt loop also lets the case be easily attached to backpacks and various other purses, luggage, and straps.this sleeve, but it would be a very tight fit, and I do not want to risk pushing accessories deep down into this tight pocket because it would then be a royal pain to extract small items from deep inside this tight pocket.

              " 'Ōkami (大神, Ōkami?) is a cel-shaded video game developed by Clover Studio for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan and September 19, 2006 in the United States and Canada. It is scheduled for release in Europe on February 9, 2007. Ōkami\\'s main character is the Shinto sun goddess named Amaterasu, who has taken the form of a white wolf. The title of the game is a pun; the word ōkami (狼) in Japanese means \\\\\\\\\"wolf\\\\\\\\\", however the kanji characters used as the title of this game (大神), also pronounced as Ōkami, meaning \\\\\\\\\"great deity\\\\\\\\\", so the main character is a great wolf deity. The same characters (大神) are also used to write the full name of the goddess Amaterasu-ō-mi-kami. Ōkami can also be read to mean \\\\\\\\\"big paper\\\\\\\\\", hinting at the game\\'s sumi-e-inspired visual style.<br /><br />Contents<br /><br />[hide]<br /><br />  * 1 Story<br /><br />  * 2 Gameplay<br /><br />  o 2.1 Weapons<br /><br />  o 2.2 Brush techniques<br /><br />  * 3 Characters<br /><br />  o 3.1 Major characters<br /><br />  o 3.2 Supporting characters<br /><br />  o 3.3 Bosses<br /><br />  * 4 Mythology and folklore<br /><br />  * 5 Music<br /><br />  * 6 Reaction<br /><br />  o 6.1 Reviews<br /><br />  o 6.2 Awards<br /><br />  * 7 Trivia<br /><br />  * 8 References<br /><br />  * 9 External links<br /><br />[edit] Story<br /><br />Set in the Nippon region in an unspecified time in the classical Japanese era, Ōkami combines several Japanese myths and legends to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the wolf, Amaterasu.<br /><br />Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.<br /><br />The quiet village of Kamiki, filled with beautiful cherry trees, had a price to pay in order to maintain their peace. Each and every year a festival is held, during which a maiden must be sacrificed to the eight-headed serpent, Orochi, signalled by a white arrow being launched into the house of his chosen sacrifice. In the 100th year since Orochi\\'s arrival, as the time for the sacrifice drew near, a pure white wolf the village dubbed \\\\\\\\\"Shiranui\\\\\\\\\" would appear and stalk the village\\'s streets at night. A swordsman in the village, Nagi (Izanagi in the Japanese version), detested Shiranui, believing him to be one of Orochi\\'s agents, and repeatedly tried to drive the wolf away. When the night of the festival finally arrived, Nagi\\'s beloved, Nami (Izanami in the Japanese version) was chosen to be slain. Determined both to save the woman he loved and to put an end to the village\\'s burden, Nagi went to Orochi\\'s lair to slay the beast. Alas, he was defeated and about to be killed when Shiranui stepped in and took over the battle. Using strange skills, the wolf battled valiantly against Orochi, but still could not defeat the serpent.<br /><br />Battered and beaten, Shiranui released a powerful howl the heavens. Strengthened by the howl, Nagi struggled to his feet and took up his sword once more, leaping onto Orochi and defeating the creature. Shiranui, filled with poison and fur dyed crimson with his own blood, was carried back to the village by Nagi where he was praised as Kamiki\\'s savior - and then died. A shrine was built in the image and honor of Shiranui, and the sword that had saved the village was interred in the \\\\\\\\\"Moon Cave\\\\\\\\\" where the battle had taken place, and used to seal Orochi away. 100 years of peace passed, and a man disturbs the sword at the \\\\\\\\\"Moon Cave\\\\\\\\\", unleashing Orochi, who is not quite as fictional as the intruder had believed. Orochi immediately begins covering the entire world in darkness and evil. In response, Sakuya the wood sprite, guardian of the village, goes to the shrine dedicated to Shiranui and brings the statue to life as Amaterasu, the Ōkami, reincarnation of Shiranui and sun goddess incarnated in the form of a white wolf.<br /><br />Amaterasu must search Nippon for the 13 brush spirits to gain the power to defeat Orochi and heal the land. Throughout the travels, Amaterasu is hounded by Waka, a strange but powerful individual that seems to have the gift of foresight, and further teases Amaterasu and Issun to his own mysterious ends.<br /><br />The 100th anniversary of the original defeat of Orochi, celebrated now by a festival held at Kamiki villiage, is quickly approaching while Amaterasu is in the process of removing the curse from other parts of the land. Returning just in time for the night of the festival, events begin to unfold exactly as they did 100 years ago: Orochi summons an arrow to indicate the chosen sacrifice: Kushi, the sake maker in Kamiki and romantic interest of Susano, a descendant of the great warrior Nagi. It is discovered that Susano himself was the one who disturbed the sword to begin with, as he despised the pressure of being Nagi\\'s descendant and did not believe that his ancestor really defeated an evil spirit. To stop the constant pressure to be a hero, he wanted to prove to the village that the story of Nagi was nothing but a myth and there was no evil serpent sealed by Nagi\\'s sword. Susano pulled the legendary sword out, releasing Orochi into the world. As it was 100 years ago, both Amaterasu and Susano return to the Moon Cave to defeat Orochi again and rescue Kamiki; as Orochi finally dies, a black evil spirit is seen to rise from the body and drift northward, but not unnoticed by Amaterasu.<br /><br />After leaving Kamiki again, Amaterasu continues to search for more brush techniques and to investigate the mysterious spirit that left Orochi\\'s body. Along the way, she encounters two more similar spirit foes - Blight, which had taken residence inside the Emperor and caused him to breath out a strange mist that was slowly killing the people and lands nearby, and Ninetails (a kitsune), who has the same god powers as the gods, and was sending evil spirits out from a mysterious island in order to try to take over the land. After both are defeated by Amaterasu, the same type of black spirit leaves the bodies and drifts northward. Following these spirits, Amaterasu is led to the snow-covered parts of the land. There, a village of humans that can assume animal forms is found and one gifted young girl has gone missing; without her song, an evil force would be unleashed upon the lands and the people implore Amaterasu to find her. Amaterasu discovers that the girl has fallen back through a doorway in time to 100 years prior in Kamiki Villiage, and to rescue her, Amaterasu must work with Shiranui and Nagi to defeat Orochi (as had originally occurred at the start of the story). Upon returning to the present, Amaterasu then proceeds to encounter two final evil beings, known as Lechku and Nechku, giant mechanical owls, which are the source of the evil threatening the village.<br /><br />There, a legend of a mysterious \\\\\\\\\"Ark of Yamato\\\\\\\\\" is discovered. The Ark seems to have fallen from the heavens 200 years ago and crashed into a frozen lake (Laochi Lake), and open up to reveal hordes of evil demons that immediately began to spread across the land. Some of these demons would go on to become Blight, Lechku, Nechku and Ninetails, and thus the black forms seen heading northward after their defeat would be these demons returning to their point of origin. Further discovery indicates that before the Ark crashed, a race called Celestial Beings had found the Ark and thought it would usable for transporting around the Celestial Plains, but it was found out too late that the Ark already had residents, and was effectively a prison ship for the evil demons. All but one of the Celestial Beings were killed before the Ark crashed, the last one fleeing the destruction. Amaterasu, with the spiritual and physical help of many others guided by the encouragement of Issun, is able to defeat all the remaining demon foes, including those she previously fought before but have returned here. It is finally revealed that Waka was the last Celestial Being and had known Amaterasu\\'s spirit prior to the crash of the Ark,and by guiding Amaterasu to the Ark and destruction of the evil spirits, Waka is finally able to return to the Celestial Plains alongside Amaterasu, using the freed Ark as their means of return.<br /><br />Spoilers end here.<br /><br />[edit] Gameplay<br /><br />Ōkami has the player controlling the main character, Amaterasu, in a paintbrush style, cel-shaded environment. The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu\\'s guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for the player to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace.<br /><br />Unique to Ōkami is the Celestial Brush.

These techniques are learned through the course of the game by completing constellations to release the Celestial Brush gods from their hiding spots.<br /><br />Combat is staged in a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a combination of weapons, fighting techniques, and brush methods, to dispatch the foes. At the end of combat, money (as yen) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage. The money can be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools, and key items for completing quests. The money can also be used to buy new combat techniques at dojos through the land. Additionally, rare Demon Fangs can be earned through combat which can be traded for additional, unique items that are beneficial in gameplay but not required to complete the game.<br /><br />By completing quests, side quests, and small additional activitives (such as making trees bloom into life, or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial brush techniques.<br /><br />The art in Ōkami is highly inspired by Japanese watercolor and wood carving art of the Ukiyo-e style, such as the work of Hokusai.<br /><br />[edit] Weapons<br /><br />The Imperial Regalia of Japan are used as weapons in the game:<br /><br />  * The reflector (or mirror) serves as a melee weapon with a fast attack rate.

Outra coisa era muito legal nos Colin McRae eram os danos que aconteciam nos carros e precisávamos consertar entre uma etapa e outra, no DIRT não existe mais, a regulagem do carro também é muito simples, bem árcade mesmo, nos Colin este quesito era mais simulador. Tb não gostei dos níveis, tem corrida que preciso colocar no nível um para conseguir ganhar, em outras ganho fácil no nível 4, não tem muito padrão. Mas de forma geral o jogo é muito bom, muito bem feito e com vários tipos de corrida para agradar todo tipo de entusiasta por lama.',\n",

Although i like the challenge, most people dont.  I think it is a very big step from the Precursor Legecy in which if you didnt beat the mission the first time, you could easly do it the second. It still has the basic puzzel/action/adventure game type which can take it up to a 3, but many flaws keep it there. Since most people like the abilty to steal flying cars from people gave you an dea that it was going to be fun. but once you got into the air you relized it was like red lights at every turn. so then you decide to go lower, maybe it will be easier to fly when there are no cars around. Wrong. Now there are poeple walking around and also the annoying gaurds. If you hit one you better start running or get ready to fight. This also occurs when you try to steal a guards hover-craft. So i ditched the car idea. Now i start walking around to find something intresting. There is a cool building, im going to check it out. Maybe i can go inside. Wrong. almost every buliding in the game is just a cheap background to make that place look more real. If the developers spent more time making the little things count besides putting people in the way and fake buildings, maybe it would be worth buying. finaly, i think it is just a rent game, but if your a person that jst has to go a little further in your game you might as well buy it and so you can finish it maybe in two years.<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~',\n",

I read some reviews saying that it doesn't work with Wii U but they were pretty old so I was hoping Nintendo or Logitech had made an update since then to make it work properly.  I figured if it doesn't work with my Wii U then I don't lose much since it was on sale.  I have used it successfully with my Wii U with Dirt 2 and Need For Speed: Undercover. I suspect that it will work with the other two &#34;APPROVED&#34; wii games. The wheel works great although the Force Feedback is not very strong at least compared to Arcade machines force feedback but it does the trick. I also notice a bit of lag but is not a deal breaker.  You do need a Wiimote to navigate the menus since the wheel does not have the infrared pointer thing.  The games won't play from the Wii U menu. You need to run them from the Wii menu.\",\n",

              " '~~~THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, DO NOT READ THIS IF THAT IS A CONCERN FOR YOU~~~<br /><br />Firstly, I\\'d like to say that I\\'m a big advance wars fan, and I was really looking forward to this game. I give the game\\'s developers credit for trying new things in DoR and trying to take the game in a new direction. Some things that are great additions to the series include:<br />-Wifi! Its great to be able to play and share maps.<br />-Actually, thats about it.<br /><br />The single-player campaign is passable, but to be honest, I did not enjoy it as much as previous installments. This game was advertised as being \\\\\\\\\"darker\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"more mature.\\\\\\\\\" Really? Given the E rating, I wasn\\'t expecting blood and guts everywhere, but did they have to add TWO 10-year-old-squeakier-than-ever Lashs\\' to the enemy team? (for those of you who do not remember Lash, she was the one who thought war was a game, and soldiers were toys.) Prepare for a lot of: \\\\\\\\\"*SQUEE!* TANK GO BOOM BOOM NOW!! BoOOM!\\\\\\\\\" At least previous installments were honest and straightforward about being a bit childish, this one attempts to hide its  juvenile story behind more sophisticated drawings. I cannot take a game that contains any of the following seriously:<br />-A virus that make you *gasp* grow flowers<br />-Characters that have and randomly lose stereotypical accents<br />-\\\\\\\\\"WHERE THERES LIFE, THERES HOPE!\\\\\\\\\" (expect to hear that, oh, 60-70 times....per cutscene)<br />-EVIL, bloodthirsty villains...who decide to play(teehee.) nice and join you. (Mr.Bear said he didn\\'t want to die!)<br />-Characters so flat that you can see right through them! (I\\'m serious. if you can\\'t predict the story from the moment you put the game in...)<br />-Story lacked spirit. Really, there was nothing interesting about it.<br /><br />Now, you may be thinking \\\\\\\\\"Thats ok, Advance Wars was never really about the story. Its all in the awesome strategy!! I can skip the cutscenes if I want and go straight to the action!\\\\\\\\\" Alright, I\\'ll agree with you here. I could forgive the story that some developer let his 5th grader write it ,if there were a noticeable improvement in the strategic gameplay to make up for it. Sadly, I do not feel as though DoR succeeded on this count either. It is mediocre, hence the 3 stars, but nothing fantastic. Lets do a run down of in-play issues and disappointments:<br /><br />-I was looking forward to gaining access to new units, but all of those added (carrier, anti-tank, flares ect) did not add much depth to the already existing gameplay.<br />-Lack of choice. In previous games, you had the ability to select your CO(s) when going into combat. It allowed you to tailor your team and your abilities to the challenges ahead. Upon failing a mission, you could go back, rethink your approach, and try something new. Heck, if you were completely stuck on one level, you could try a different one (typically, 3 or so were unlocked to you at a time) and take a crack at the problematic level later. It did not effect the story, but it allowed you to take a break from a frustrating level. In DoR, this is not the case, only one level at a time can advance the story. (Yes, there are side \\\\\\\\\"training\\\\\\\\\" levels, but they are even more aggravating and uninspired than the regular gameplay and have nothing to do with the story) This customization is sacrificed in the name of a piss-poor story that forces you to use one pre-designated CO per map.I would have loved more user customization, not less.<br />-The game designers advertised that CO powers and abilities were being reduced placing more emphasis on strategy. This is true for your units, not so for the enemy units. I am not complaining of difficulty here, its not that it is ridiculously hard, just irritating. You scratch an enemy unit, and then they turn around and one-shot yours. Prepare for a lot of \\\\\\\\\"huh? why is my unit dead?\\\\\\\\\"... For the record, simply making all of the enemy units stronger is not a satisfying way to create difficulty, try again.<br />-One more note on COs and CO powers: they feel more like an afterthought in this game, and may as well not be there. You don\\'t even get them til well into the game! The COs do not lend themselves particularly well to any of the maps that you are forced to play on. Don\\'t expect fancy flight-action when you get to play as an air-specialist! Mostly its a lot of generic play with Wil. Previously, more interesting COs allowed for more creative level design that would allow them to shine. Choosing the correct CO for a level was an important part of play!<br />- Difficulty could have been implemented through creative level design, this is also not the case. I felt like level design produced dull, repetitive, uninspired, slam-your-head-into-the-enemy-til-he-falls-over-50-turns-later style play with only a few interesting exceptions. I wish there had been more of the interesting ones.<br />-Lack of hard mode and other unlockables. Part of the fun of the previous games, for me, was unlocking all the nifty stuff in the war room, and trying my luck at the hard mode campaign. This had very little to do outside the single player. Like I did point out, wifi is great, so if you have lots of friends with AW, this may not be such a big problem.<br /><br />SHORT VERSION FOR THE LAZY:<br />Days of Ruin had a lot going for it, its still an OK game. You\\'ll probably chug on through it and enjoy it just fine. I suppose I just had very high expectations for this game, and it fell far short. I can only hope that things improve in the future. Shinier graphics and \\\\\\\\\"cooler\\\\\\\\\" (see: stereotyped and boring) characters do not redeem a completely ridiculous storyline, mediocre single player game, and lack of unlockables.this game, and may as well not be there.

              " '~~~<BR>Well, I bought this game thinking that it would have the immersive gameplay characteristics of Baldur\\'s Gate combined with significantly updated 3D terrain effects and graphics. I was half-right in the fact that the graphics are very nicely done, but the gameplay is just, well, missing.<br />The games NPC\\'s made my ears hurt as I listened to the mostly unimportant dialogue they utter. Add to that the fact that most of the goodies you pick up will not be usable at the time you find them since there are strict attribute requirements that must be met.<br />Example: After a brawl you get a suit of armor and sword that both require a minimum strength of 22, your brawniest party member is at 16. By the time he gets to strength 22 he is carrying around an entire backpack (and pack mule) of items with minimum strength requirements of 27-30.<br />The spells are pretty to look at, yet somewhat underpowered even at high levels. I have a bow that doles out 68 damage at a pop, but my best spell generates around 30 damage. Item placement and spell strength just seem a little unbalanced.<br />Instead of Baldur\\'s Gate with imporved graphics, Gas Powered Games has delivered Myth on steroids. What I bought is a nice piece of graphics technology - a beautiful graphics engine with little else wrapped around it.<br />I\\'m always amazed at how liberally people throw around \\\\\\\\\"five-star\\\\\\\\\" reviews for not only software, but music CDs too. I gave this product two stars because it\\'s fun factor is less than average FOR ME. Other people new to PC based RPGs may find it more engrossing than I did.

              " \"~~WARNING: Tried to keep it generic, but there are a few spoilers.<br /><br /> The game looked amazing in all of the previews, CGI commercials, and initial impression write-ups from the big game reviewers.  In summary, I played the game through in 77 hours and I ended up enjoying about half of the game.  I was disappointed with the story(s), felt that a lot of the pre-launch hype was flat out false, found that that the game was buggy, and was extremely annoyed with the process used to import save files from DA:O and DA:2.  It is worth picking up when the price drops, but it is not a must have.<br /><br /> DA:I starts strong right where DA:2 left off.  Bioware does a great job of throwing you right into the mix with a sense of urgency.  Everyone is panicked at the cataclysm that has taken place, but they have cautious optimism that you and your gifts can help.  You can feel the weight of everyone's hope in you.  This continues through the first half of the game.  The characters are awesome to interact with and the story is strong.  You see that you are making progress as people gather to support your cause, feel like you making the enemy nervous, and that you are a beacon of hope despite so much crisis in the world.  A couple major plot points identify your true enemy and his intentions for the world.  I was constantly thinking to myself “this is awesome!” and I was annoying my wife with story recaps at dinner just about every night for 2-3 weeks.<br /><br /> But, the pacing gets off the tracks the 2nd half of the game. You have to build up your power points to make the main plot progress.  This can be done via the many companion, NPC, and Inquisition side questions.  Some are really fun, but many are bland MMO style fetch or wienie horde stomping chores.  As the story progresses, it takes more and more power points to go to the next major plot stage.  As a result, you will find yourself grinding mundane side quests quite a bit.  Grinding for the power points needed to advance the main story throws off the pacing several times in the second half of the game.<br /><br /> If you are like me and really get into your game companions, you will probably find that there is not enough companion material to carry you through to the end of the game.  At about 45 hours of my 77 hour play through, I had most of the major companion quests, romance threads, and party banter played out (I started getting reruns).  At this point, they had nothing new to say when talking at the keep or when adventuring.  It felt like they were empty NPCs and that they had lost their purpose.  I LOVED the cast in this game and it was very frustrating to have their roles fizzle out before the end.<br /><br /> I kept grinding through side quests despite these pacing issues because I wanted to maximize my Inquisition forces.  I eventually got bored with the repetitive generic side quests and decided to try the final battle with the Inquisition I had.  Figured I was going to be stomped with my level 17-18 characters and with all the alliances I still had not secured.  Tragically, your Inquisition forces play NO part in the final battle and the final battle was boring and easy.  It was so anti-climactic that I initially thought another plot twist was coming, but to my disappointment, the credits rolled.  There was cliff-hanger post-credit cut scene, but all it did was drag me down more because it was obviously a setup for something more.  I hope EA did not pick apart the story to sell the remaining pieces as DLC as they did with Mass Effect 3.  I am not sure which is worse, a botched ending or a company selling an incomplete product without letting consumers know up front.  Either way, the game peaks about half way through and coasts downhill until the end if you are a completionist.  It may be that the main story is paced to be a 50 hour or so adventure and that most of the side quests are blah filler there for marketing talking points (i.e. game length, contentclaims, etc).<br /><br /> Leading up to DA:I’s launch, Bioware and EA talked about a vast modular open world (big zones) and lots of exciting places to explore.  I felt that the open world was generic, empty, and not very exciting to explore.  Some of the areas were huge on the surface, but the vast majority of the sparse caves, landmarks, and towns in the world were small, empty, and generic.  You could not interact with most NPCs or many of the environments.  Many of the key cities in the game were not accessible (i.e. Deneirim and Orzamarr) and access to the Deep Roads was limited to just a few small entrance areas.<br /><br /> Bioware and EA pushed the “Lead Them OR Fail” tagline and routinely emphasized how crucial your decisions were in the game.  After you complete the game, you will realize that all your choices in the game did not matter.  You get some different wording and a few different slides at the end of the game that depend on a couple of the game’s key choices, but that is all your choices build to.  They make little to no difference in the overall story or the ending.  Try making a new game and making choices opposite to those in your first game.  The main story and ending will not change much at all.  You really just have the illusion of choice in this game.  The illusion is dispelled in the last major plot stage.<br /><br /> When the graphics were fully loaded, the game looked good through an XB360 and a 720P plasma screen TV.  The text throughout the game was near impossible to read from any distance, though.  This included menus and captions.  The font was small, narrow, and a bright shade of white.  Graphic flashing, meshes not loading, NPCs not loading (AKA ghost towns and keep), characters falling through the ground, characters slipping through walls, loading screen freezing, and character voice scrambling were common occurrences.  The game patch sent out early December helped with the freezing, but not with much else.  Bugs were ahuge distraction and broke the game a few times for me.  For some reason, the meshes would not load on the sides of mountains in the Hinterlands and on some of the dragons in the game.  Both looked like big masses of Play-Do as a result.  The bugs broke the game several times for me.<br /><br /> The game did not start out as planned.  I pre-ordered the deluxe edition for the XB360 in hopes that I could carry-over my DA:O and DA:2 save files.  Not sure how I missed it, but you cannot easily carry-over your previous games even if you stick to the same older consoles.  You have to use the DA Keep through EA's Origins system to create a generic &#34;tapestry&#34; of your previous major decisions in DA:0 and DA:2.  It supposedly can reference your old save files through your XB360 if your Origins account is synced with your XBLive account, but it does a poor job of it.  It found only one of my two DA:2 save files and could not find any of my four DA:O save files despite everything being saved on the same XB360 hard drive.  So, I made most of my &#34;tapestry&#34; manually from what I recalled from the previous games off the top of my head.  Once the file is created, the game will look for it when you are hashing out a character at about the 5th step of the new character creation process.  You must be online, logged into XBLive, and patient for it to work.  You might have to go back in the character creation screen to restart the tapestry importation process a few times.  It finally found the tapestry on something like the 4th try for me.  After it is loaded, it will not give you trouble again.  The advantage of the Origin's tapestry system is that makes it possible to carry a consistent story across different systems.  This has a lot of promise, but EA needs to work out a lot of bugs and provide users with clear directions at games' launches from now on.  Would it have been that hard to add some directions to the game's start screen?\",\n",
              " '~rE\\\\/;e\\\\/\\\\/~<br /><br />I just had the best time in January. It\\'s the fresh start of a new year, the month that brung me the new season of \\\\\\\\\"24\\\\\\\\\", and a resolution that I made in that month to be a free-spirited citizen. Oh wait, that\\'s also the month that released the new \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil 4\\\\\\\\\" for the gamecube. Forget about the free-spirited promise, I was wasting what\\'s left of my life, completely exhaust myself, and failing at the beginning of spring college playing non-stop at this revitalized, genuine sequel of a redundant creepi-fied series. I\\'m positive that almost every gamer was doing the same thing.<br /><br />Leon S. Kennedy is back six years after Raccoon City was \\\\\\\\\"sanitized\\\\\\\\\" and Umbrella was finished (or are they?), and I get to play him as a special US agent going to a hispanic country in Europe to rescue the president\\'s little girl. What could\\'ve been a simple save-the-damsel-in-distress job, he eventually had a run-in with the villagers. Not the wholsome, agriculture-crazed villagers anime fans seen in \\\\\\\\\"Inuyasha\\\\\\\\\", but villagers with the urge to kill him. They\\'re vicious, strong, wise, and possibly seen the spanish-dubbed version of \\\\\\\\\"Deadwood\\\\\\\\\", since they seem to have the case of \\\\\\\\\"Sweareng-itis\\\\\\\\\", pun intended. They\\'re not zombies, folks, they\\'re corrupted beings. Not only must he save the President\\'s daughter from harm, he must figure out why the hicks have gone muy loco. Honestly, as refreshing the story is and a few plot twists it has, the story isn\\'t gonna win any awards, but the game itself can win alot of oscars.<br /><br />Everyone should get the picture how great this game is: Excellent graphics with no FMVs whatsoever, nice aiming addition, cool split-second action buttons, blahdah-blahdah-slab. Unlike other people who rave the positives of this game, I\\'m gonna be a little creative and list the flaws that are in this game. Just because the game is great, it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect. Onto the cornucorpia of flaws:<br /><br />- The graphics may be excellent, but it\\'s not flawless. This glitch happens ever so often, even when it\\'s spontaneous. It\\'s clipping. I have that funny glitch whenever my character\\'s weapons magically go through walls or when one of the bad guys stabs me with a pitchfork through one. It\\'s better when I don\\'t fight bad guys in close combat, or else their motionless body might eat me. And I know I\\'m not the only one that likes to walk through a huge dead orge from their chest. Collision detections or collision issues are the real damage to the technical side of the visuals.<br /><br />- Lack of death sequences, especially on Ashley. I have no problem escoring the Chief\\'s little \\\\\\\\\"ballistics\\\\\\\\\" brat through some parts of the game (she\\'s even helpful sometimes), and if she\\'s dies, I usually degrade myself for letting her die so horribly. That didn\\'t work for me, because no matter if she\\'s stabbed, mutilated, or burned alive, her deaths\\' gonna be in the same damn christ-like beauty position every time. If Leon\\'s gonna get his head decapitated, his face melted, and his neck chewed up, I expected the same results coming from her. Absurb.<br /><br />- If I can have Leon reload his weapons on-screen, how come I can\\'t do that on the menu screen? Intended? Might be, but it\\'s ever more hasseling to reload when there\\'s an enemy in front of me.<br /><br />- The rewards I\\'ve gained are plentiful, maybe too plentiful. I got almost all of the secrets by beating it once, and nothing more. This game would\\'ve done better I earn some of these extras by skill. How\\'s about gettin\\' the infinite rocket launcher when I beat the game in hard mode? CAPCOM should\\'ve made some redeemful use out of the ranking system this game had, but it\\'s there for show. Replay value is filled, yet limited.<br /><br />- This is, personally, the most obvious flaw this game has: it\\'s not scary! Creepy, but not scary. The past RE games are clasutraphoic and severly limited to any human contact, not to mention the cheap boos, is what made the series kept me on the edge of my seat, not knowing what\\'s gonna pop in and kill me. \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil 4\\\\\\\\\" is free-roaming, and almost expansive to the point that I feel too comfortable on the enviroments I\\'m in. Sure, a blind baddie with claws barging from the cage is shocking, but nothing beats the shock of Mr. X suddenly crushing through the walls from the other room (RE 2 reference). Add that to the abundance of ammo and the aiming system, and the action-crazed gameplay makes the game itself lose the enviromental thrills that spices this horror meatball of a franchise.<br /><br />Since I listed these flaws, are those going to change anyone\\'s mind about buying this game? HELL NAW! There\\'s just too much good in \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil 4\\\\\\\\\" to consider it non-recommendable. There are so much variety in the game, and so much great moments (my favorite is when the villagers climbs up the ladder and I pointed the gun at their face when they appear on top, and I shoot them, hearing them yell as they fall to their doom; I laugh every time). It\\'s worth noting for having the most intense boss battle ever in video game history (the water boss). With some RPG elements, vastly improved camera system, interactive cut-scenes, and a lengthy adventure (I beat it in 22 hours on my first try), \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil 4\\\\\\\\\" is on the level of greatness. There\\'s more room for improvement, and this may not add the fear to the horror gerne, but it certain adds a lot more fun to it.<br /><br />F|NAL \\\\/\\\\/ORDS: Gruesome Achievementa pop in and kill me. \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil 4\\\\\\\\\" is free-roaming, and almost expansive to the point that I feel too comfortable on the enviroments I\\'m in.

From Arcade to master weapon, this game is nothing to make fun of because it's hard and challenging, beautiful graphics and it has amazing soundtrack that keeps you in the mood of fighting!

However, this game also has many flaws outside of gameplay. The cutscenes are maddening. This game is more movie than game, and~~ while the movies furthur the magnificent plot, there are far too many and it could be condensed. If you have the patience to sit through half an hour of movies, move your character 3 steps, then sit through another half hour, you will love this game. For the rest of you, it will tax your nerves. It is, like its predecessor, very short. There is about 15 hours of gameplay counting the huge amount of it that is movies.  If there were, sasy, 5 hours of movies, then 20-30 hours of game would~~ compensate.  But for this game's 8 hours of moviesathere are 4-8 hours of game.

              " \"~Once again Sega's latest attempt in the sports arena shows incredible attention to visual detail with sharp images and those funky little extras [like broken glass, and Roy's Gatorade bottle.]  This time however it seems  there was definitely a lack of focus on player likeness which is sub-par in  comparison with what we've come to expect after seeing the likes of NFL2K  &amp; NBA2K.   Game play is very realistic and smooth, after all we are on  ice folks.  The game's engineeers did a near flawless job in seeing that  player attributes were captured and exhibited, i.e. Lindross will be hard  to knock down, and Federov will be fast as hell.  Player creation is a  treat as complete autonomy is left at the hands of the user - if you want  to give birth to the eternal god of the frozen oval, you are free to do so  without limitations or restrictions on points.  Unfortunately, other than  height and weight, you have no control over appearnce.   The impenitrable  commentary of Cole is far superior to any hockey game we've yet to find,  though Neale's color commentary could have been a bit more juicy.   Now for  the shortcomings.  First, MORE CHECKING MOM!  I've never been to a Flyers  game where there wasn't at least one scuffle due to the high level of  contact.  I once replaced half the team's players with my own creations who  were all 99's in aggression and still saw only infrequent and random  muggings.  With regards to scoring, some may complain about difficulties,  but the truth is, that too is ultra-realistic.  It's not uncommon to see a  15 minute game end 2 - 0, so don't think you're going to put one in the net  everytime you get a break away cause it just ain't so.  Next we have line  and coaching changes.  Do yourself a favor and put line changes on auto, it  makes things alot more bearable.  The display screen that pops up when  trying to execute either of these commands invades gameplay far too  intrusively, and could stand to be simplified.  By the time you've  finnished making adjustments your left scratching your head wondering how  Nolan got possession and is looking to let one fly at your goal [good thing  the goalies are fairly solid].  Finally, WHERE IN THE !@! ing ! @! IS THE  HORN!  You score a goal, Cole says &quot;He scores.&quot;, with nearly as  much enthusiasm as a corpse on caffiene, get a weak 3 second replay, and  your back at the face-off circle.  Dissappointing.       With regards to  the camera angle, I would defenitely recommend the side view.  The vusuals  are stout enough so it in no way looks flat.  In fact, a friend of mine  said that for a second he thought it was television broadcast, and I'ld  have to agree, it looks pretty damn close.      The bottom line?  If you  like hockey, you'll like this game.  Despite a couple of minor flaws, its  the most realistic I've seen, with superior commentary and visuals [when  played on the 'side' camera setting].  4/5 starz.\",\n",

              " \"~If you have not played this classic, then barring illegal actions, definitely get this game. Why?<br />If you new to RPGs then this is a fun and easy to understand game (in terms of both control and story) that is not very difficult and does not involve tedious &quot;level building&quot; essensial to most other RPG classics.<br />If you are familiar with RPGs then you wouldn't want to miss one of the (the in my opinion) best RPG game. Let's look at each component of the game:<br />Graphics: nothing compared~~ to todays 3D graphics and FMVs. But one of the best 2D graphic games. The characters are beautifully animated, something that can never be realized in a 3D game. Special effects are not going to be awe inspiring but they are sptacular nevertheless. The world map is considered one of the best.<br />Music: The best. Although there won't be any lyrics since this is pre-PS, the melodies are the best. I would highly recommand getting the soundtrack. Many beautiful music are in my playlist and they~~ remind me of the wonderful moments in the game.<br />Character: All seven playble characters have rich backgrounds. I don't want to spoil it but inevitably you will find yourself attached to some if not all of the charachers.<br />Story: Superb. It will not be as confusing as most final fantasy games (or movies). The story is pretty straight forward yet very well developed. Plenty of twists that engage the gamer yet unconfusing. The game is also very logical and thus believable, you won't be asking~~ yourself &quot;how come (s)he's so stupid?&quot; in this game. Although the depth of the main plot is not as great as others such as FFVI,FFVII,FFX, the best part about this game is secondary story and history. Even side charachters such as Cyrus or Schala begs sympathy, not to mention other playable charachters. The theme of time travel for the story is also extremely well polished, with a deep history. The time issue is eventually explained clearly.<br />Gameplay: The time travel as forementioned is~~ great, the battle system is innovative and untedious. Double and Triple techs is probably the best feature that should be included in other RPGs. You will not find as many sidegames as the FF series that require countless hours, yet there are enough optional quests to satisfy any gamer. One of the best gameplays ever.~\",\n",

There are short, 30 seconds or so, scenes between each of the missions/games where you watch a clip of dialogue between all the characters. Depending on if you are successful or not with the previous mission will determine which clip plays each time. The missions are arcade like games, which have an almost Ice Age Olympics feel to them. Skiing, sliding, bowling, tossing and other types of competitions, where you first compete, then the pirates team competes, and who ever has the highest score in the end wins. While the games may look simple, they take several tries to complete successfully. However while in story mode, you only have one shot at each competition, and which ever team has more wins in the end gets the treasure. There are 20 competitions, so the whole game can easily be completed (not necessarily won) in an hour.<br /><br />Tournament Mode: Basically the same as Story Mode, only without the movie dialogue clips, and you play against someone else. It\\'s the 2 person version of story mode. So you and someone else both get to compete against each other. You can either use 2 Wii controllers or you can share a single one by passing it back and forth.<br /><br />Free Play: This mode gives you the chance to play any game in any order, and as many times as you would like to. There is no story or dialogue, just pick which competition you would like to play and begin.<br /><br />~Controls~<br />You use a regular Wii remote for the game, however about 80% of the competitions you will be turning the remote sideways. It seems as though the game was designed more so for another gaming system, and then it was altered to work with the Wii remote. I find in many of the games the controls are a bit difficult, especially for what seems should be a very simple competition. Thankfully before each round, it is written on the screen and also verbally explained how you should hold the remote that round and what buttons to push for which action. This is the only good aspect of the game, since it is a great feature for kids too young yet to read.<br /><br />~Graphics~<br />Not the best. Definitely not the graphics of a Mario Galaxy or Lego Star Wars game.<br /><br />~Age range~<br />I\\'d say this is safe for all ages. The pirates aren\\'t scary at all and the dialog is all appropriate. There\\'s no double-meaning jokes or anything like that included. All the instructions for each game are spoken out-loud by a character in addition to being written and pictured on the screen, which is great for young kids who are not yet reading or at least at a level high enough to understand the words how they are written. If anything, I think this game is much better suited for young kids, about 8 years old and younger. The story is very simple and little kids will have no problem following what it going on, especially if they have seen the movie. However one doesn\\'t need to have seen the film to be able to play it.<br /><br />~Conclusion~<br />The game will most likely only appeal to very little kids. A person can go from beginning to end in less than an hour. It has some potential for replay-ability because the mini-games/competitions are such a challenge, you need to practice to win them. But truthfully, it\\'s so boring, you\\'re not likely to want to play it again. The graphics are lacking, but for a very young audience, that may not be an issue. Everything included in the game is all age appropriate, however most everyone age 10+ will probably find this game isn\\'t as fun as other games out there are. My 11 year old son summed it up well with his comment after playing through the game...\\\\\\\\\"That\\'s it?

This is the only good aspect of the game, since it is a great feature for kids too young yet to read.<br /><br />~Graphics~<br />Not the best. Definitely not the graphics of a Mario Galaxy or Lego Star Wars game.<br /><br />~Age range~<br />I\\'d say this is safe for all ages. The pirates aren\\'t scary at all and the dialog is all appropriate. There\\'s no double-meaning jokes or anything like that included. All the instructions for each game are spoken out-loud by a character in addition to being written and pictured on the screen, which is great for young kids who are not yet reading or at least at a level high enough to understand the words how they are written. If anything, I think this game is much better suited for young kids, about 8 years old and younger. The story is very simple and little kids will have no problem following what it going on, especially if they have seen the movie. However one doesn\\'t need to have seen the film to be able to play it.<br /><br />~Conclusion~<br />The game will most likely only appeal to very little kids. A person can go from beginning to end in less than an hour. It has some potential for replay-ability because the mini-games/competitions are such a challenge, you need to practice to win them. But truthfully, it\\'s so boring, you\\'re not likely to want to play it again. The graphics are lacking, but for a very young audience, that may not be an issue. Everything included in the game is all age appropriate, however most everyone age 10+ will probably find this game isn\\'t as fun as other games out there are. My 11 year old son summed it up well with his comment after playing through the game...\\\\\\\\\"That\\'s it? That\\'s the whole game?\\\\\\\\\"',\n",
              " \"~Firstly, I just have to say to potential buyers that the Wii remote is NOT a major issue~<br /><br />  There are a lot of reasons to love this game, ranging from unique characters, to just bizarre and off-beat enemies, and no matter what, it is a memorable classic that is easily one of the best games of its kind (i.e. more art-oriented). The 3-d art is beautiful and all of it is very different than anything else you will find on the Wii. The game combines it's open-world aspects and mini-stages, such as battles or interactive cut-scenes, wonderfully, giving the player plenty of ways to either avoid unnecessary combat or grind relentlessly for dragon fangs. Many characters will have you laughing or crying by the end of the story (and some even have a weird mixture of both!), and though it feels short lived for such a magnificent game, there is a whole host of side content to unlock upon beating the game.<br />  My only real concerns about this game are the issues of its conversion to the Wii, and game balancing; for the casual gamer, this is a fun little story to wander around in at a nice, easy pace. However, for a hardcore gamer, or one that focuses on clearing the  game as quickly as possible, it is just way to easy. I breezed through the first half of the game in just a few hours, and I finished the entirety of it two days later after a break. Not to say that it won't take time to discover all its secrets, just that I was so excited by the story-line that I couldn't help but push forwards and find the end. The enemies are mediocre at best, and simply switching between spamming physical attacks against enemies and slices could get you through most of the game (this isn't true about boss fights, all of those were awesome!).<br />  Another concern, echoed by many people on the 1 side of the spectrum, are the motion controls. I just want to say that I steeled myself for beginning this game and my first challenge with the brush was.... painting in a river. It's thatsimple. The only times a shaky hand or faulty sensor hampered me was in the knocking down this random wall person who randomly popped up in places all over the island (seriously, is there just a factory that produces them and then catapults them to random places of the globe or what?!) other than that, there is nothing too difficult to master after 3 or 4 tries. This realistic brush control added way more to the game than it took away. Seriously, unless there is something wrong with the remote and the player is slow and careful with their brush strokes, there is no way to mess it up in any game-destroying way. It's just one of the games that actually fully utilizes the Wii's motion controls. It's what makes the Wii actually deliver on its reason for existence!<br /><br />  So anyway, in summary, if you own a Wii, you absolutely must get this game!<br /><br />(Also, sorry if this was a horrible review. It's just my first so please don't flame me if I offended anyone by saying the controls were easy. I just don't think they were any reason not to buy the game.)\",\n",
              " \"~First of all the people complaining about it being too hard clearly didn't take five minutes to adjust it.  You can adjust just about everything in the game so if it's too hard make it easier duhh.  Secondly for realism this game is second to none.  I have played all the nhl, faceoff, nhl2k series, since 93 and this is the best.  Hitting is easier then they make it seem.  All you have to do is move the right analog stick in the direction of the opponent not charge up and hit extra buttons. ~~ Although it takes a little time getting used to the controls they allow for much greater detail.  You can play the puck from in between your feet and pull off some amazing moves with pinpoint precision.  The franchise mode is amazing, allowing everything from setting practices to investing more money in staff and equipment upgrades, to even adjusting ticket prices.  This is the first game where free agency actually means something.  I.E you can get real players and being that you also have~~ revenue constraints to worry about you actually can lose a good player.  Finally a game that makes a franchise mode worth investing some of your time into.  The potential rating allows you to gauge which low tier players are worth investing money into for future seasons and trading draft picks means something.  There are admitedly a few flaws.  I agree with the not displaying types of injuries and time left remaining on them is plain stupid. Also players do tend to accrue rediculous stats.  I~~ am barely half way through and there are guys at 100 points or more.  But considering the fact that winning means fans fill the seats so no matter how many 100 point guys the other teams have i'm still number one in revenue and playoff position makes these flaws overlookable.  If you have been looking for an NHL game with the feel of the real NHL and adaptability that just can't be found anywhere else then this is the game for you.~\",\n",

The Funny thing is that the stuff they stripped were really easy text-based encoding, like the number civilizations and their cities.

              " '~*There are many videogames that have outstanding graphics and a good storyline.  However, I can think of only one game that has outstanding graphics, good storyline, and amazing gameplay.  That game is Drakan.  Here we are presented with a game that is one a kind.  The expansive environments, exploration, and beautiful landscape design boasts some of the most fascinating outdoor environments that I\\'ve ever witnessed in a game of this sort.  Mountains that majestically soar luminously above while a gently flowing waterfall cascades downwards as Rynn and Arokh glide past.  It has dynamic lighting effects which add to the depth of the gameplay and everything is just so perfect.  I can honestly say that I had no complaints whatsoever about anything with this game I was so pleased. <br />   <br />     ~Storyline:  Rynn begins her journey after a tribe of creatures, Wartocks and Troqs, invade her peaceful mountain village and slaughters the inhabitants and inslaves the rest, including her younger brother.  Afterwards, Rynn is journeying forth to the caves and mines while having an array of weapons and special combat moves at her disposal the entire time.  Jumping, crouching, and special-combat moves; this game has got it all.  Further into the game Rynn befriends an ancient, mystical dragon named Arokh that has been in slumber in an underground cavern who she can eagerly mount upon and fly to anywhere in the game.  The most positive aspect is simply that you can trandescend anywhere in the game without any loading times and explore anywhere that is available at your disposal.  This game feels fresh, innovative, and new to me when I play it and I admit this never gets old or repetitive like most games. <br /> <br />     ~Gameplay:  Now, this is one of the main highlights of the Drakan series.  Gameplay in these games are so perfect and well-done.  From the special-combat slashing moves that Rynn can perform with her mace or axe to the aerial fire-breathing attacks that Arokh supplies from the sky.  You\\'ll find that this is in the same category as the \\\\\\\\\"console god mode\\\\\\\\\" games and I do wish that more games would adopt this type of gameplay stle.  Drakan has an original mapping and exploration/gameplay style that, for when it was released, was far ahead of its time in terms of gameplay. <br /> <br />     ~Sounds:  Drakan: Order of the Flame has ambient renderings that can, at times, sound like synth orchestra or you can simply hear the light rustle of rain and wind mingled with natural sounds of nature, such as frog croaks, animals, water flowing, etc.  I feel that this adds to the overall presentation of the game and gives it a greater depth.  Very nicely done. <br /> <br />     ~Overall:  What else could I possibly say other than \\\\\\\\\"Buy this game if you find a copy anywhere! This is by far the best PC console/fantasy game ever created.\\\\\\\\\"  You will surely not be disappointed with your purchase and hopefully will come to love Drakan as I and many others have over the years.  This game features so many gameplay aesthetics and gorgeous scenery that enthrall the gamer to want to continue to play.  Drakan is simply one of the best fantasy adventure games ever created for the PC and you\\'d do yourself a favor to pick up this title!',\n",

That depends.<br /><br />The Collector\\'s Tin has a solid metal packaging that\\'s looks cool in its overall red pallete with a rough title logo, even though it\\'s not exactly rigid to take on heavy damage, and the \\\\\\\\\"Gamestop\\\\\\\\\" logo on the front can be bothersome to look at.  Other than the game itself, the Tin also contains a mini-art book, which is actually a 22-page digest recaping on the past RE games other than an actual art book.  It also includes an authentic cel art of Leon.  Because of the size of the package, however, the cel art is short and the art isn\\'t exactly high-res.  For those who are think about the free soundtrack it offers, BE WARN.  This \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil 4\\\\\\\\\" soundtrack is actually A MUSIC SAMPLER CONTAINING 6 METAL SONGS FROM THE RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES.  So if you\\'re hoping for some ambient tracks from the game, don\\'t bother with this soundtrack offer.<br /><br />Overall, is it worth it?  Personally, this item doesn\\'t do justice, becuase I thought the Collector\\'s Tin would have more oomph in its inclusions, but what it has, it doesn\\'t offer much.  If you\\'re THAT big of a \\\\\\\\\"Resident Evil\\\\\\\\\" fan and the packaging and what it offers looks cool, go ahead and spend it.

Just recently( about 2-3 days ago ) the headset completely stopped working for the PC ( and I tried it on my PS3 10 minutes ago to find out it's not working on that either).<br /><br />The headset works fine with my xbox but that's only because Xbox 360 doesn't use usb microphones, it uses a special separate adapter to connect to the controller while PC and PS3 both use the headset via USB (this is how the headset is powered and how the PC and Ps3 detect and use the microphone).<br />The main reason I bought this headset was for PC and PS3 use since I already had a headset for Xbox 360, but now it works only for 360 which is frustrating.<br />I contacted their technical support to resolve the problem with no avail, they say I should file a claim but I got this headset in October of 2011, can I still file a claim on Amazon after that amount of time?<br /><br />Anywho, this headset is a great buy when it functions properly.<br />The price is great compared to other high end headsets that have the same capabilities but cost more.<br />It was a 5-star for me up until two-thirds of the headset stopped functioning, so now its a 2.w its a 2.\",\n",

I'm a huge fan of space flight games like Elite:Dangerous, Jumpgate, Vendetta Online, Starport Gemini and so on, but I didn't want to dish out hundreds for the immersion a simple throttle + joystick combo can offer. Long story short: I should have.<br /><br />For a budget HOTAS this one of very few options on the market, which is a huge shame. The throttle stick isn't terrible and would work fine on its own (if you don't mind a little inaccuracy around the &#34;catch&#34; zone when trying to fine tune your thrust for landings), but the joystick is simply awful, with massive deadzones on every axis and very inconsistent, cheap-feeling tension throughout the movement ranges. For a game like Elite: Dangerous, precise yaw control is crucial for micro-adjusting your aim when you've got an enemy in the crosshairs, and the awkward tension of this joystick's yaw axis combined with its large deadzone will leave you swinging dramatically to the left and right of your target. Beyond the poor movement and feel of the stick, the cheap plastic makes a groaning/squeaking sound that I wasn't able to ignore, though I imagine this might have gradually improved if I had taken the time to break in the stick and wear down whatever component was causing the sound.<br /><br />If none of the above deters you, then congrats! Performance aside, the entire unit feels comfortable to hold and the button placement feels fine, if perhaps a bit sparse. I was able to compensate for the lack of buttons by programming multiple button presses simultaneously, effectively grouping commands by treating the buttons on the throttle stick like &#34;shift,&#34; &#34;alt,&#34; &#34;control&#34; and so on. I found that the cable between the two sticks was long enough to let me rest each stick comfortably at shoulder width, but not long enough to allow my keyboard to fit between them, which made my overall setup pretty awkward and cumbersome. I tried playing with both halves of the unit connected, but I felt cramped and contorted, so I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />If you simply MUST play with a HOTAS, but you're shopping on a budget and you don't mind trying to aim and steer as though you're riddled with Parkinson's, then go ahead and throw money at this stick. Otherwise, keep shopping around. I returned this product and eventually settled on a dual-joystick setup for about the same price that I much prefer.to hold and the button placement feels fine, if perhaps a bit sparse.

I plan to make it up by including some facts that hopefully will help you.}}    The developer of this game Kaos Studios was formed in 2006 by THQ for sole purpose of creating FPS games. Kaos launched it\\'s first game [[ASIN:B000UB3B3W Frontlines: Fuel of War]] in 2008. It was an average game. Now 3 years later Kaos has released Homefront, which is in some sense similar to Frontlines...drones, emps, global crisis etc. If you liked Frontlines, you most likely won\\'t be disappointed by Homefront. The only downside over Frontlines is possibly the fact that they lowered maximum pc player number from 64 to 32. Anyway getting to Homefront now...    SINGLEPLAYER:  There\\'s been a lot of hype about the single player campaign. It is written by John Milius, co-writer of [[ASIN:B003UESJJC Apocalypse Now (Three-Disc Full Disclosure Edition) (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux / Hearts of Darkness) [Blu-ray]]] (1979). If you\\'re into storylines, then you\\'ll most likely love it. There\\'s enough dialogs in the game, the characters are uniquely build. If you\\'re into shooting, then there\\'s some good shooting for you.    The downside is --  (1) A typical gamer would be done with the missions in ~4 hours. If you\\'re planning on buying Homefront ONLY for singleplayer mission, then it\\'s not worth $50.  (2) You\\'re continuously being told what to do which includes following your teammates till the end. I personally don\\'t mind that but I figure there are people who prefer to do things there own way. Meanwhile, the upside is your teammates let you use the toys. You get to use Goliath from time to time... and Chopper too...both are loads of fun!    MULTIPLAYER --  Multiplayer is what everything this game is about.   I really like two unique features of this game:  (1) Battle Commander game mode: Each team has a AI commander. They assign \\\\\\\\\"priority threat\\\\\\\\\" to enemies who go on killstreak.  (2)Points System: this allows you to \\\\\\\\\"buy\\\\\\\\\" weapons on the go. I can buy RPG (given I have enough points) to take out a tank that\\'s pissing me off. Nomore hiding from the tank b/c I don\\'t have the correct loadout. I hope other games think of features that allows me to get weapons on the go.    The bad--  (1) The graphics aren\\'t amazing. For me it has more than my computer can handle. But I\\'ve heard some people say it\\'s going backward in terms of graphics. Just thought I should throw it out there.  (2) Animation for grenade throw is awful. Hopefully they\\'ll patch it up.  (3) There aren\\'t that many types of gameplay. COOP is not there. I personally am a sucker for COOP gameplay. There\\'s no attack and defend type of game mode either??  (4) Not completely destructible environment.   (5) You need steam. This will annoy those who don\\'t like steam.  (6) Installation procedure is awful. I downloaded ~7.5 GB from the site I bought Homefront. When I tried installing it started steam for me. The game got added to stream BUT...wait for it...I still had another 50% (or maybe 30% i can\\'t remember exactly) to download off stream. That had to be one of the worse installation procedure for a game.    Other random thoughts...  (1) You can prone in this game.  (2) I\\'ve heard talks about sinper being overpowered. I didn\\'t notice much of this on my first day of gameplay.  (3) The \\\\\\\\\"enemy spotted\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"need a ride\\\\\\\\\" radio feature seems something like that of Battlefield 2 (?) / Play4Free.      Lastly I realize that lots of you still aren\\'t sure if you want to buy this game or not. This is possibly why you\\'re reading these reviews to being with. I don\\'t blame ya, they gave no demo or beta for us to test. I would suggest you to watch videos over youtube (there are plenty there already...and many more to come). And if you\\'ve got questions, feel free to drop comments. I\\'ll keep an eye on it for next few days/weeks.',\n",

Dawnguard is a castle in Skyrim itself on your map. Bethesda also added tons of new caves and forts so you can accompany the main quest. This is a no spoiler review so I will just leave it at; you can either follow the main quest and be a Vampire Hunter. Or you can accept the agreement of the vampire Demon Lord and become a Demon Lord. That's not a spoiler - it was in countless interviews with Todd Howard and even in commercials. But there are other surprises along the way if you stay a Vampire hunter.<br /><br />As for the main game; everything is fixed. All the bugs, crashes, quest drops, etc. The game is perfect. I have most of all the locations discovered on my map and it looks awesome. Like I said, I am at level 41 with an easy 150 hours on my main character - not to mention 200+ hours in total gameplay. As for my main character, I still have plenty to do; mages quest, multiple side quest, a lot of misc quest to finish up, and to clear all of the locations I have discovered.<br /><br />With BF/Holidays coming, get this game, it will consume your life and there will be plenty of sales on it.<br /><br />{updated, 75 hours in, level 32}<br />Game never gets old, however, I would not download the latest 1.2 patch Bethesda put out. Apparently it messed up a few things and I would just not download it and play offline. I am sure Bethesda is working on the problem.<br /><br />{updated, 50 hours in, level 28}<br /><br />This game continues to bring a fresh breath of air each and every time I play it. I have not done any guilds, have done only 1 part of the main mission (went to high harothgar to make unrelenting force more powerful), and haven't done a lot of the 'big' quest. I have concentrated on cave/ruins/fort looting with my sneak/bow master with some 'misc' quest mixed in. I have over 120 locations discovered and around 50 cleared. This game has exceeded my expectations in almost every way imaginable. For me, and in my opinion I will add, is the game of the generation and GOTY 2011.<br /><br />{updated, 16 hours in, level 13}<br /><br />This game has exceeded my expectations and I didn't even know that could happen because I set such a high bar for it. Everything in this game is smooth, no more glitches, bugs, freezes, etc. It runs so similar to fallout 3 with graphics and NPC except they are much smoother and responsive. The character animations have improved greatly, no more weird, awkward NPC talk. Skyrim is basically Fallout 3 graphics and animations but much smoother and improved, and everything great about Oblivion but much more polished out. It seems as if the Fallout 3 crowd loves it, but hated Oblivion. The magic is very smooth and amazing, however, you will need to increase your magic significantly if you want to be a pure mage... I am a hybrid because some monsters are quick and you cannot hit them with any spells. Marksman also serves a great purpose in this game. That is all, enjoy!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />All I can say is wow, I am not going to go into depth too much because this game is full of spoilers...<br /><br />Animations are incredible, character detail is incredible, story is incredible, NPC is absolutely better than Oblivion, lock picking is similar to Fallout 3, graphics are top notch, character leveling up is simplified and very easy to understand, and there are plenty of things to do.<br /><br />Story {Quests}: 9.5/10<br />Graphics {ran in DX9, had to because of all the detail and mere size of this game}: 9/10<br />Fun: 10/10<br />Sounds: 10/10<br />Longevity: 10/10<br />Interaction: 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 9.6<br /><br />Like I said, that's about all I am going to go into it....

Unlike the other FEAR's it has no replay value.}<br /><br />Let me first say that I'll be first in line to bash SecuRom and I refuse to purchase a game with it.

Hopefully, it's just a learning curve.<br /><br />Cons (most are minor):<br />- no saves or quick saves - my biggest gripe. The game seems to have secret checkpoints along the way. It would be nice to at least know when you pass one.<br />- I hate reading files and you pick up a lot early in the game.<br />- no lean, but I can do without.<br />- they remapped the E and F keys from earlier Fears. It's logical, but I keep hitting the F key to open a door and my flashlight goes on. I'll eventually catch on.<br />- graphics are strange. It's grainy, like you're in a haze. Not sharp like the early Fear. It also seems to have a narrower field of view.<br />- cut scenes between levels are too long.<br />- certain menu commands require hitting the spacebar or enter key instead of a mouse click.

              " '{EDITED}    Almost half a decade ago an online game broke that set the standards for every production to follow. Everquest was its name. The world created by the Everquest team seduced the players into many a sleepless night and wasted day slaying dragons, orcs, goblins, etc while attempting to further advance their characters magical or melee abilities. That wasn\\'t what brought everyone to this game though. It was the idea that you did all of this with other real people from across the globe. Sort of an internet chat coupled with a role-playing game. You want to be in a group with you buddies\\' cleric (a healing class) that lives in New York while you sit in California or even Japan with your warrior? No problem. Send them a message and gather a few more friends to start your party at slaying the evils of the land.    Sony Online Entertainment took full control of this Massively Multiplayer Online Game, MMO\\'s for short, quickly after it was released and has enjoyed the largest subscription base for any game of its kind in North America. Now they take it up a notch.   In its first incarnation Everquest, EQ for short, was rather simple. Gather a team, hack/slash, cast spells, slay the beast, rinse, repeat.   Some of the larger encounters of the game took a little more strategy but nothing overwhelming. The world you explored, Norrath, was plain as well, trees, hills, sky, nothing extremely impressive. All of the previous tedium and blandness has been overhauled and restructured in Everquest 2, which will ship on November 8th 2004 simultanesouly in the US and Europe.    I was lucky enough to Beta Test Everquest 2 since this passed July. Let alone played EQ1 for almost four years. The upgrades and changes are without a doubt AMAZING. The first thing one will notice is the beauty of the game.   The water reflects your characters appearance as you run by slightly distorted as the ripples break its surface. The grass and flowers you run through sway and bend in the breeze.Large groups of butterflies kick up as you trot along the fields. Leaves fall from the trees in the glades and forests.   The artwork alone sucks you right in from the moment you begin. The npc (non-playing characters aka \\\\\\\\\"computer controlled) talk to you as you walk by, interact, or attack them with REAL VOICES. By the release of the game Sony promises to have voice-overs for every npc possible, taunting you to buy their wares, accept their quests, or bash their faces in. These are just the ambience effects. The characters themselves are a separate entity of beauty.    Your characters are breathtaking. Imaginative hair-dos, highly textured armor and weapons. Large choices for skin color, facial features, shapes, and even little things like piercings, tattoos, and accessories are at your disposal. Sixteen different races are available ranging from your typical human, towering barbarians, seductive elves, stout dwarves, gnomes, alien-like Erudites, and goodly halflings. The monstrous races make a return as well, which include ogres, trolls, iksar (a lizardman like race), the feline kerra, dark eves, and the new race the Ratonga (half rat half man). Each with their own racial traits to customize and toy with. One of the greatest parts of the character creation process is that unlike EQ1, EQ2 allows any race to be any class. You want to be a sweet frail-looking wood elf that dons the massive suit of armor swinging a giant sword? You can. So you are looking for the giant ogre that hates to get his hands dirty so he wields powerful magics? Go for it.The class system is also split into three \\\\\\\\\"subclasses\\\\\\\\\". Starting out as either a fighter, mage, priest, or scout you progress into a subclass at your tenth level then a specialized class at your 20th. These specialized classes are more often then not based upon your characters alignment. You see, the world of Norrath used to be comprised of a few continents with most races hailing from their own city... Not anymore.   The once great empires of elves, humans, darkelves, etc have been crushed, lost, or gone into hiding. The only remaining cities are the noble and good Qeynos and the evil oppressive Freeport. The two cities reflect their faction better than one could imagine. The feel of Qeynos is something out of a movie. Children play in the streets chaseing cats and dogs. Merchants shout sales pitches to look at their wares. You really feel like a hero from the times of King Arthur while on the streets. This is the complete opposite in Freeport. The merchants and guards scowl at you. They threaten you to buy their wares or else. Pushing the evil envelope to the limit. You begin to really feel the oppression of the city from the moment you enter. Fans of the darker races will adore this. These little accents help with immersion immensely. The quests given to your character make you really feel like your helping the unfortunate soul that sent you on them. This can also be a curse in disguise. With immersion this good real time seems to disappear and an hour of game play is easily turned into four as you fight your way across the shattered lands of Norrath.   The combat system is completely revamped. With EQ1 you could easily hit auto-attack and just sit back. Now you have heroic opportunities that help your group or harm the enemy which need a certain \\\\\\\\\"combo\\\\\\\\\" of ability usage to take effect. Combat \\\\\\\\\"arts\\\\\\\\\" that cause the damage to turn the tide of battle. Arrays of magical spells to heal, harm, or cripple your foe. The animations for the arts and magic fit perfectly, be it summoning an arc of lighting forth from your hands to spinning around backwards to thrust kick the orc standing in your way.  I can honestly say that in my opinion, this game is what every single company in the future will try to copy just as before with Everquest 1 almost half a decade ago. The combat system is fun and engaging making one actually pay attention to what they are doing as the battle evolves. And an environment that brings the virtual world to life from start to finish. Without a doubt, there are going to be many \\\\\\\\\"magically sick\\\\\\\\\" people calling into work the second week of November.       -Doug Kerry',\n",
              " \"{Based on the Dreamcast version of Sonic adventure}. It is worth paying $... becuase all the charictars are fun to play as with their unique moves and tricks and their are 6 not including super sonic; the charictars are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Big the Cat {you see him in parts of sonic adventure 2 battle}, and E 102 codename Gamma a robot made by Eggman {Dr. Robotnik} who has a more sad quest with Amy Rose and his brothers E 101 Beta and E103-5. The boses are fun to fight against for all charictars. The plot is realy cool and exciting. And the levels are nice and well made but not anything to win a gold over but still fun. The only thing that I didn't like is walking around in station square, The rain forest, and The big ship made by Dr. Robotnik becuase it is frustrating to find things and you need to find all the levels yourself and some levels you need to do tricks {the casino level} or get a key that is put far away {about 3 levels need it}to unlock and it can give you a headache.<BR> <BR> Otherwise it is a great game and worth $.... I give it a 4 out of 5. A five if they fixed all the exploring you have to do unlike in Sonic adventure 2 battle You see the plot and then it takes you to a level or boss without having to find it yourself so I hope it is better in this directors cut of the game from Sonic adventure from the dreamcast version from 1999 which this game is based on has improved.\",\n",
              " \"zzz~~~ (I haven't sleep since yesterday after I bought this game) Well, before I start, just want to say this game can definitely keep you awake all day and night. This version for PS2 (I also got the Ps1 version) is really rocks, it gives you the total control to any player. You can do any unbelievable tricks or special abilities on this game (not on the PS1 version). The game is extremely realistic, you gonna feel you are in the World Cup with the crowd right when you play it! The graphic is awesome, EAsport really did excellent job on any minor details on stadium, player's face, movement, and even the ref's face!!! But I have to say that this game is not easy to play~ That's all because you have absolutely total control on every player's tricks and moves, it also got the power meter on lob, pass, and shot. It's kind complex at beginning, and it's different with the Ps1 version, (Ps1 version is MUCH more easier).

I curved the protector down to keep bubbles from growing.  i slowly pasted it down until it was perfectly centered.  REMEMBER, once the protector under the sticker is down and clear, IT CAN'T BE REMOVED.  i was able to reapply it a few times because i made sure the protector wasn't completely applied.  i did the same thing for the top screen, with no bubbles and a few dust particles    i didn't know the protectors were different sizes, so i ended up peeling one off, but for the wrong screen... which is why i have a few dust particles stuck, otherwise, it would have been perfect.\",\n",

              " \"Good B-Ball game, a little better graphics, more realistic movements and computer play than 2k11. Some players look better, other players (Like Rondo, Doc Rivers) look like they are tired and sick, and not quite as good as the graphics from 2k11. But overall more player graphics look as good or even more realistic than 2k11.  A little more difficult than 2k11 as well. the Pro level in 2k12 is as difficult as all-star level on 2K12 (so each level is kicked up a notch) but this is still a fun game.<br /><br />My only major grip with 2k12, as with 2k11, is that the computer determines when you can bounce pass. I find this ridiculous, because there are like a million different offensive moves, layups and defensive moves you can execute by pressing different buttons (they can get very difficult to remember during fast moving play), yet your point guard can't execute a simple bounce pass in traffic?  This is very annoying on fast breaks, for you'll have a 2 on 1 break and instead of a simple bounce pass to your player running down the wing, the computer will pass the ball right into the chest of the one defensive player who is hanging out near the basket. This makes no sense, no legitimate NBA point guard would botch such an easy pass.  Sometimes when you're running a play or getting into an offensive set the computer will give you a bounce pass, but not when you really need one, like on a fast break or passing to your power forward who is closely guarded in the low post.  I don't know why the programmers of NBA 2K don't fix this, you can execute so many types of layups and dunks, and defensive moves, but not a simple bounce pass?  This leads to so many turnovers in the game and limits how your guards can pass the ball. Still a fun game overall, however.\",\n",
